<p class="drop-cap">The waiting-room of Dr. Maude’s surgery
at Monkswell was sparely furnished with
guests, mainly because the December weather
was of that mild and unseasonable type commonly
called unhealthy. The darkness outside
was pierced by a fine, invisible rain, borne
on a south wind, and the waiting-room,
though heat as well as light was spread only
by a single gas-burner, was not cold. One
patient was with the doctor; the details of his
complaint could have been overheard by the
others if they had cared to listen, but they
did not; sufficient unto them were their own
diseases. Five centres of self-complacent
misery were sitting on a cane-seated bench;
the sixth person was leaning against the wall
with his hands in his pockets. The only other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
representative of the male sex was eight years
old, and had come to have a tooth out; too
stolid to feel nervous, he sat sucking peppermints.
His mother, in a decent black mantilla
and a square-fronted bonnet trimmed with red
chrysanthemums, was talking to a girl with a
baby about wrongs invisible to the unjaundiced
eye. The young mother’s dark eyes and
delicate features had the remains of real
beauty, though two years of matrimony had
made her middle-aged; her pretty young sister,
sitting beside her, showed what she must have
been. The baby was not handsome; its pinkish-purple
face was framed in a yellow woollen
hood, and the colour which should have tinged
its cheeks had settled upon its ugly little button
of a nose and on its chin. It wheezed; the
mother coughed loosely; the girl stared before
her; the young man also coughed, but inobtrusively.
He did not give to phthisis its
due dignity.</p>

<p>The surgery presently discharged its patient
and received the small martyr to toothache.
The young man took the seat left vacant; and
the gaslight, falling on his face, showed thin,
brown features, eyebrows strongly arched and
strongly marked, and bright, vagrant eyes
which took an interest in everything. He
edged a little closer to the young mother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
looked inquiring. Finding that did not answer,
he plunged into conversation with a
speech which was admirable in sentiment but
not discreet in wording.</p>

<p>“Jolly baby, that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was a fine boy,” said the girl, her
tired eyes quickening as she looked down at her
child, “but he’s after his teeth now, and it’s
pulled him daouwn awful. We didn’t have a
wink of sleep with him last night.”</p>

<p>“You must be pretty tired, then,” quoth
the stranger. “Wonder if the little chap
would come to me?”</p>

<p>“He don’t like strangers,” said the mother,
doubtfully. She was unused to hear her boy
called either a jolly baby or a little chap; and she
distrusted the abilities of a young man, plainly
unmarried, moreover, who used such terms.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold him like a patent rocking-chair,”
the stranger asserted. “Come on, sonny. You
won’t howl at me, will you? Great land, what
a weight you are! I never turned ayah before—yes,
put my eye out, will you? What’s
wrong besides the teeth?”</p>

<p>“He’s got a touch of bromtitus; I caught it
washing-day, and he took it from me. Oh, it’s
crool work washing in the winter; our houses
hasn’t any coppers, and we has to do it all out
at the back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean you wash the clothes in the
open air?”</p>

<p>“Every mite of ’em. My husband he’s been
to the landlord times and again, but he won’t
do nothing for us; and they’re the cheapest
houses round, so we just have to put up with
it.”</p>

<p>“What a beastly shame! Who’s your landlord?”</p>

<p>“Old Fane, up at Fanes. Ah, he is a hard
man. Last time as Mr. Searle went to see him,
‘You can take or leave it,’ he says; ‘I can get
plenty more as won’t complain. I will not be
pestered with discontented gutter-birds,’ he
says. So my husband he come away; there
wasn’t nothing to be done.”</p>

<p>“Fane, I think you said,” said the brown-eyed
stranger, upon whose face the tale had
painted a gleeful anticipation, as he took down
the name in a pocket-book. “I’m thinking I’d
like a little friendly conversation with Mr. Fane.
Whereabouts is your place?”</p>

<p>“Burnt House, they call it; right out in the
fields it is. If he’d put in one copper for the
six houses, you wouldn’t think he’d ever miss
the money. But he don’t care about us poor
folks. I wish we was in Farquhar’s houses,
that I do.”</p>

<p>Conversation was here broken by Dr. Maude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
who summoned Mrs. Searle and her sister and
the baby. Her short interview left her in
tears. The doctor had ordered milk, which
seemed to her as far beyond her means as caviare
or turtle-soup. It would be got, but meanwhile
Mrs. Searle would starve, Mr. Searle would
swear, and the debt at the shop would grow.
The stranger gave her a shilling, and fled into
the surgery to escape her thanks.</p>

<p>The place smelt strong of drugs; shelves
laden with bottles climbed up one wall, and the
others were decorated with framed photographs
and cases of medical books. Everything was
strictly professional and methodically neat;
and the doctor, slight and dark in appearance,
cool and composed in manner, was the essence
of his room embodied.</p>

<p>“What’s your trouble?” he asked of the
stranger, who stood before him interested and
insouciant, his hands still in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Hæmorrhage from the lungs. Oh, I’ve had
the charming complaint before, and I know the
ways of it; I’ve been despaired of three times
already. But I’d like you just to tinker up
my old constitution, if that’s possible.”</p>

<p>“When did the hæmorrhage occur?”</p>

<p>“I had a smart attack Sunday, and it’s been
off and on ever since.”</p>

<p>“Then you ought to be in bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Quite so, Æsculapius, but I haven’t one.”</p>

<p>“There is the workhouse infirmary at Alresworth.”</p>

<p>“To which I’m on the way; but I didn’t
think I could git.”</p>

<p>Then there was silence, while Maude applied
his stethoscope. After testing the lungs he
tried the heart, and after the heart other organs,
and soon discovered that his patient was a collection
of inceptive diseases. His questions
elicited a tale of ill-health lightly borne in which
he did not believe, for stoicism is rare in surgery
patients.</p>

<p>“I don’t know your face—where do you come
from?” Maude asked him.</p>

<p>“I was at Alresworth with a travelling company
as a kind of a sort of a shadowy understudy
of a sub-super, but I knocked up Sunday
and was left behind. Nobody missed me.
I can’t act any more than a dead egg,” said the
patient, candidly—“ninety-nine, ninety-nine,
ninety-nine; is that enough? But that don’t
matter in the profession. Hullo, were you in
the cricket-team at Queens? Nice game, cricket.
I always shone in it myself.”</p>

<p>He disengaged himself, and walked across
to study the photographed groups on the wall.</p>

<p>“Come back, please; I have not done with
you,” said the doctor. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, <em>I</em> don’t know—John Smith, I guess.
Last time I played cricket was near the English
cemetery at Iquique. Jolly ground it was,
too. There’s never a drop of rain from year’s
end to year’s end, so the turf isn’t too good;
but we had thousand-foot precipices on three
sides of the ground, and what could you ask
more? We played till Saunders made a boundary
hit, and then we hadn’t a rope long enough
to fetch up the ball. Next time Saunders went
up there was after Yellow Jack had done with
him. My hat! it was hot enough for kingdom
come. The very abomination of desolation;
red hills, and never a blade of grass, except
the thread of green where the water comes
down from the snows.”</p>

<p>“Well, John Smith,” said the doctor, “I
can’t do much for you; your constitution’s
rotten. You had better stop talking, take
this medicine, and go to the infirmary, if it’s
true that you have no home. A motor ’bus
passes here at seven, and goes to Alresworth.”</p>

<p>The patient made a grimace. “More land of
counterpane for me, I suppose. Passes here at
seven, does it? I shall certainly be ’bus-sick;
but, after all, tout passe, tout casse, tout lasse.
Take my tip, Æsculapius, and don’t you drop
your cricket. Good-night.”</p>

<p>It was only half-past six. Maude felt an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
impulse to recall the picturesque stoic and bid
him wait in the surgery until the omnibus
passed; but honesty is a rare quality, and the
stranger, by pleasing him, inspired him with
mistrust. An observant man, he noticed that
John Smith spoke French like a Frenchman:
a Parisian could have detected the difference,
for his accent was that of Guernsey: but Maude
had learned modern languages at a public
school. In brief, the rain was inaudible in the
surgery; the stranger was a questionable character;
and Maude did not ask him in.</p>

<p>John Smith went out whistling; his frame
was lean and gaunt and loose-jointed, but he
walked with a fine swing. The surgery was
the last house of the village. Some hundred
yards further on the railway embankment
spanned the road, and a lane turning up just
beyond it led to the station. John Smith,
sauntering along in the increasing rain, found
shelter beneath the arch and stayed there. The
wind blew up from the south straight through
the tunnel, and the scene circumscribed by the
arc of masonry was wild and beautiful. Across
the black sky raced a froth of fleecy clouds,
through which a half-moon shone, girt by a
pallid zone of blue and bronze. The wild
streamers were so unearthly pale, the heaven
so solemnly dark, that only by the moon’s presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
could sky be told from cloud. Gray hills,
crowned with dark soft masses of woodland,
folded down to a valley deep in mist, where a
cluster of golden lights burned like a constellation
magnified by rain; while up to his very
feet the streaming road was turned to a sheet
of glory by a common street-lamp.</p>

<p>John Smith immediately brought out a penny
pencil and a penny exercise-book and began
to write. Valiantly disregarding the inequalities
of the brick-work, he rested the paper
against the wall. He had thought of some elegant
words and phrases for describing the evening
sky, and wanted to fix them fast on paper
before they escaped from his volatile memory.
Actor he had been by chance, artist he was by
nature; an artist in words, he professed himself
gravely; a lover of apt phrase and finely balanced
sentence; one of that happy confraternity
whose goal in a strange room is always the
bookcase. He had as many interests as ideas,
but this reigned paramount.</p>

<p>The wind blew, and the rain came with it.
It may have been the cold, or it may have been
the weight of Mrs. Searle’s baby, or it may have
been the inevitable sequence of his disease,
which suddenly arrested the writer’s hand, and
made him, choking, press a handkerchief to his
lips to quell the flow. He knew how to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the attack, and, lacking any other couch, lay
down in the road; he could not well be wetter,
and a mud-bath, at least, is warm. His handkerchief
was drenched, but the stream did not
stop. Presently the moon dimmed before his
eyes, and his own troubled breathing seemed a
far-off sound. It crossed his blurred mind that
he was about to solve the great riddle, and go
out with the wind; and he reflected with satisfaction
that Dr. Maude, who had unmercifully
turned him out into the rain, would be visited
by pangs of conscience. He felt neither fear
nor elation, but a certain regret in leaving a
world which he had persistently enjoyed in
spite of all; after which consciousness went out
like a spark, and John Smith lay still in the
road.</p>

<span class="fs80">HE THAT SHOWED MERCY ON HIM</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Ten minutes later a train passed southwards
across the arch. It had discharged
passengers at the station, and among them one
who soon came driving down the lane in a high
dog-cart fitted with pneumatic tyres, acetylene
lamps, and a correct groom sitting up behind.
As it turned the corner the horse, a handsome
chestnut signally well groomed, shied violently
at John Smith’s prostrate figure, and was
promptly checked by the driver, who had him
well in hand. He looked back over his shoulder.
“What’s that, Simpson?”</p>

<p>“Drunken man, sir,” said the correct groom,
stolidly.</p>

<p>“Pleasant weather to lie in the road. Still,
will you?” He gripped the reins as though to
curb the restive horse gave him pleasure. “Just
go and see if he’s all right, Simpson. He’ll
get run over lying under the arch there.”</p>

<p>Simpson got down. He resented his master’s
charitable fads when they affected his comfort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
but he dared not complain. It was true that
Mr. Farquhar carried generosity to his servants
to its extreme limit, but those who transgressed
his laws had to go. He bent over John Smith
and announced with undeviating stolidity:
“Been fighting, sir.”</p>

<p>“Fighting, has he? Come and hold the horse
for a minute.”</p>

<p>Servant and master changed places, and Farquhar
in his turn scrutinised the features of
John Smith. He moved the stained handkerchief,
sniffed at his lips, laid a finger on the spot
where the pulse should have beaten, and then
stood up.</p>

<p>“Shift the seat as far forward as it’ll go.
Yes; now put the cushions in the bottom of the
cart. The rug over them. Is the back let
down? That’s right.” He picked up John
Smith and shouldered him as if he were a gun.
The luckless artist in words weighed less than
eight stone, but the strength required to lift
him so easily was very great, and was shown
more remarkably still when Farquhar raised
him up at arm’s-length to put him into the dog-cart.
Simpson lent his assistance, protesting
only by silence against the introduction of a
drunken and excessively muddy prodigal between
the folds of the new carriage-rug. His
discretion was rewarded by his master, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
explained, as he took his seat again and picked
up the reins: “It’s a case of illness, poor chap.
The man’s not drunk.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Simpson, touching his
cap; but he did not believe it. Even the irreproachable
Mr. Farquhar was no hero to his
groom.</p>

<p>About a mile beyond the arch Simpson had
to get down to open a gate, and the dog-cart
drew up at the front door of The Lilacs, which
was the pleasing name of Farquhar’s bachelor
residence. It was a large modern villa built
of red brick and white stucco, boasting Elizabethan
mullioned windows on the first floor,
modern bays below, a castellated turret, and a
Byzantine porch with a cupola, which tasteful
decorations the officious ivy had done its best
to veil. Inside, the house was furnished well
and, before all things, comfortably; it was heated
by an arrangement of hot-air pipes in the Russian
fashion, and cooled in summer by genuine
punkahs. John Smith was carried in and laid
before the library fire; Simpson was sent to
fetch the doctor, and the master of the house
himself attended on the muddy stranger. Farquhar
was a wonderfully good Good Samaritan.</p>

<p>He began by stripping off John Smith’s wet
clothes, noting that the shirt, which had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
its best and almost its worst days, was neatly
marked in a woman’s writing with the name of
Lucian de Saumarez. His other garments,
which were in better condition, bore only the
red cotton hieroglyphics of the laundress. Few
people could have excelled Lucian de Saumarez
in the art of dressing badly; his hat alone would
have roused envy in a scarecrow. Farquhar
did not dare to give him brandy, but he began
to practise a remedy potent as alcohol and safer.
Kneeling beside the parchment-covered articulated
skeleton on the sofa, he ran his fingers
over him with subtle, measured movements,
unpleasantly suggestive of the coiling and uncoiling
of a snake. He had learned the art
of massage among strange people in a strange
land; it seemed literally to recall the spirit to
the body it had quitted.</p>

<p>Lucian de Saumarez became conscious of existence
in a tingling thrill of warmth which crept
all over his frame. The return to life was exquisitely
delicious; a deep peace rapt him far
out of reach of pain, and his mental faculties
came back one by one while yet his bodily sense
was drowned in dreams. But, suddenly, he was
aware of a change, the truth being that Farquhar
had paused in his task. Vague discomfort
followed; then he opened his eyes and saw,
as a vignette beyond a tunnel of darkness, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
face of a man reading a letter. That letter,
written by a woman’s hand on thick blue paper
with a gilded monogram, was familiar to
Lucian; it was the same which he for nine years
had carried close to his heart. Without wonder
he saw the dream-stranger turn the page and
read to the end, he watched him fold it up and
put it back in its place; and then the trance
reabsorbed him, and again he revelled in delicious
dreams under the magic touch of Noel
Farquhar. Some minutes later he came to
himself completely, and discovered what was
being done to his unconscious frame. Lucian
looked on massage as first cousin to hypnotism,
and hated both, with all the lively independence
of a character which could not bear to place itself,
even voluntarily, even for a moment, at
the mercy of another man’s will. Prepared
with a strong protest, he opened his eyes and
was struck dumb. In the open English face of
Noel Farquhar he recognized the dream-vision
who had read his letter.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’ve come to yourself,” said Farquhar,
pleasantly. “You’re with friends; don’t
speak. The doctor will be here directly.”</p>

<p>Lucian put up his eyebrows, sent his eyes
straying round the room, and brought them
back to his host’s face with an air of inquiry.
Farquhar smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>“How you came here? My horse shied at
you and I picked you up. My name’s Farquhar—Noel
Farquhar.”</p>

<p>“M. P.?” said Lucian, who was by fits an
ardent politician.</p>

<p>“Quite right. Can I communicate with your
friends?”</p>

<p>“Don’t own any.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t say that long. Now you
really must not talk any more; I sha’n’t answer
you if you do.”</p>

<p>As he evidently meant to keep his word,
Lucian subsided, and gave himself up to observing.
The room was conventionally furnished,
but he saw on the floor the skin of a black panther,
and behind the door the nine-foot spiral
ivory horn of a narwhal, trophies which even
Whiteley cannot provide. Himself a wanderer,
he rejoiced to see such tokens of his host’s pursuits;
a sportsman is kin to a sportsman all the
world over. From studying the furniture he
turned to study Noel Farquhar.</p>

<p>Most people knew the name of the member
for Mid-Kent, and his face was tolerably familiar
through the slanderous presentations which
the papers call portraits. He had been in Parliament
for several years, and was supposed
to be a coming man. When he got on his
legs, members deferred their engagements; his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
speeches were generally lively, always pithy,
and never long, a trinity of virtues rare as the
Christian graces, and, like them, culminating in
the last. He had the advantage of a good voice
and delivery. As a politician he was incorruptible;
he would criticise his own party, when it
seemed in danger of deviating from that ideal
of rectitude which animates the bosom of every
British statesman. A Bayard without fear or
reproach, a high-souled patriot with a caustic
tongue, he had a niche all to himself among
parliamentary celebrities.</p>

<p>He stood in his socks only five feet nine, but
the width of his shoulders was exceptional, and
his frame was lean and hard and supple as a
panther’s. Every muscle had been trained and
trained again to the pitch of excellency, and
every movement had the sure grace of controlled
strength. The comeliness of perfect health and
physical fitness was his; he diffused a kind of
tonic energy which acted on susceptible people
almost like an electric current. For the rest,
he was the typical Englishman: fair-haired,
grey-eyed, sunburnt, pleasant, in spite of the
grim curve of cheek and jaw, which matched
the almost ominous strength of his physique.
Lucian, like other people, would have accepted
him for what he seemed, if he had not seen him
deliberately reading through his love-letter. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
it was, he looked into the fair, open face and
knew him for a humbug; though he could not
imagine why he should have read it, nor how
it could advantage him to befriend a miserable,
sordid, reprobate, and degraded outcast such as
Lucian de Saumarez.</p>

<p>Dr. Maude came hard on the heels of
the returning Simpson; he did not resort to
Bob Sawyer’s tactics to increase the reputation
of his practice. Farquhar met him in
the hall and brought him in, and the patient
overheard an edifying fragment of conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t very well leave him out
in the road, poor chap, so I had to bring him
along.”</p>

<p>“And he will probably recoup himself from
your plate-chest.”</p>

<p>“What a cynic you are! I never thought
of such a thing,” said Farquhar, laughing.</p>

<p>“Your innocence must stand in your way
sometimes, I should think.”</p>

<p>“I never knew it do so. I believe, myself,
that trust begets trustworthiness.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re a philanthropist,” said Maude,
walking into the room. The patient lay quiet,
apparently unconscious. “I expected that it
was this fellow you’d got hold of,” Maude said,
without surprise. “He came to me an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
ago. I told him to go to Alresworth infirmary;
I suppose he had an attack while waiting for
the ’bus.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you might have let him wait
in the surgery.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably a thief. I don’t profess to
be a philanthropist, myself.”</p>

<p>“Philanthropist, indeed!” said Farquhar.
“It’s not philanthropy I’m feeling for you,
doctor.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Maude responded, proceeding
with his analysis of Lucian’s bones.</p>

<p>“You persist in crediting me with virtues I
don’t possess.”</p>

<p>“Modesty’s your great fault; every one knows
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, yours isn’t over-amiability, anyhow,”
returned Farquhar, again laughing.</p>

<p>Satirical compliments are more difficult to
meet than most forms of attack, but Farquhar’s
unconsciousness was a perfect piece
of acting. Lucian wondered whether Maude
knew the motive of his philanthropy. As a fact,
Maude knew nothing and suspected merely because
Farquhar was a virtuous person; he would
have believed that the Apostle Peter got himself
martyred for a consideration, and canonised
by a piece of celestial jobbery. Being put
to rebuke, he confined his conversation to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
subject of Lucian’s illness, and in a short time
the prodigal was installed in the best room
and fed with the fatted calf under the form of
tinned essence of beef.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">For several days Lucian was kept dumb by
the tactics of his host, who walked punctually
out of the room as soon as the invalid
opened his lips. In half an hour he would return
to the chafing guest; and then, if Lucian
remained silent, he heard the paper read aloud,
but if he dared to speak he was once more left
to himself. As Lucian was eminently gregarious
and hated his own society, the discipline
achieved its object. He was treated like a
royal guest, and repaid his host by vivisecting
his character. The ground of his suspicions
seemed trivial, but was substantial. Feeling
the letter in its old place, Lucian sometimes
wondered if he had dreamed that scene. But,
no, he knew it was real; for the reason that he
had seen on Farquhar’s face as he read an expression
which he could never have imagined.
What he suspected was not very clear; but
Lucian had an inquisitive disposition, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
interests at this time were limited in number.
Hence his exaggerated curiosity.</p>

<p>The church at Monkswell was heated by
pipes which on mild days brought the temperature
up to seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and in
cold weather left the air in such a condition
that to uncover his bald head was a severe
trial of the parson’s faith. The weather had
changed, and Farquhar, coming in after service
on Sunday afternoon, went straight to the
fire to warm his hands. He was an exemplary
church-goer.</p>

<p>“Cold?” inquired Lucian, who was now allowed
to talk a little.</p>

<p>“Bitterly. The snow-wind’s blowing; we
shall be white to-morrow, if I don’t err.”</p>

<p>“Gale at seventy miles an hour, temperature
twenty degrees below zero; yes, I’ve tried that
out in Athabasca, and it didn’t suit me,” said
Lucian, whose rebellious body appreciated luxury
though his hardy spirit despised it.</p>

<p>“My faith, no! but I’m not sure that twenty
degrees below isn’t better than a hundred and
twenty above.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice preparation for the bad time
coming,” said the incorrigible Lucian. “Talking
of which, what was that devilry you used
when you carried in my fainting form?”</p>

<p>“Devilry, indeed! It was massage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>“Not the ordinary, common or garden English
massage, sonny; I’ve tried that.”</p>

<p>“Massage is massage all the world over, I
should have said. However, I learned mine
in Africa.”</p>

<p>“And who was your moonshee?”</p>

<p>“An old Arab sheikh who wore immaculate
robes, and carried a dagger with a handle of silver
filigree and a very sharp point, with which
he prodded his slaves when they failed in their
duties. Are you satisfied now?”</p>

<p>“No, not in the least; but I didn’t expect to
be. Who’s old Fane?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said Farquhar, mildly,
“your mind reminds me of a flea. Mr. Fane
is a farmer hereabouts, a kind of local squire.”</p>

<p>“Is he well off?”</p>

<p>“Tolerably, I believe. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Old curmudgeon!” said Lucian. “Stingy
old miserly murderer!”</p>

<p>“One at a time, I beg,” said Farquhar.</p>

<p>“Well, he may be an angel incognito, but
his war-paint’s unco guid, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“How has he roused your righteous wrath?”</p>

<p>Lucian related Mrs. Searle’s story, waxing
eloquent over her wrongs, and illustrating his
points with rapid foreign gestures, as his manner
was. Farquhar compressed his lips, which
already joined in a sufficiently firm line. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
know those houses,” he said; “they are unfit
for habitation. I tried to get them condemned
a year ago. Want a copper, do they? They’ll
never get it from Fane.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d tried what starvation’s like,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>“Have I? I was a thousandaire till I was
four-and-twenty,” said Lucian, clasping his
lean, brown hands behind his head—“but since
then, devil a penny have I had to spend! My
head is bloody but unbowed beneath the bludgeonings
of Fate—W. E. Henley. I’m proud to
say I could take the shine out of Orestes.”</p>

<p>Farquhar sat down by the fire and pulled the
tea-table towards him. He was very useful
at an afternoon party: could always remember
the precise formula for every person’s several
cup. “How did you lose your money?” he
inquired, flavoring his own tea with lemon, in
the Russian style.</p>

<p>“Sixteen thousand in one night playing
écarté, sonny. No, don’t preach; I never gamble
now I’ve got no money. Besides, on that
memorable occasion my circumstances were exceptional.”</p>

<p>“Exceptionally bad, I should think. What
did you do?”</p>

<p>“What did I do? Commenced author, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
I flatter myself I should have made a decided
hit, only I was overtaken by what another
distinguished author calls Bluidy Jack. The
medico swore it was the writing brought it on.
I also swore, in many tongues, and had a second
go; I held on gallantly for three months, and
then went to a hospital, and a nurse fell in love
with me. ‘Those lips so sweet, so honey-sweet—’
We swore fidelity. I shared with her
my fortune—we broke a sixpence. She had
three hundred a year and a large soul. Inconstant
creature! On getting my ticket-of-leave
from the hospital I introduced her to my
chief pal; and would you believe it? the base
villain borrowed my first fiver to elope with
her with.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens, de Saumarez!” said Farquhar,
laughing against his will, “you don’t
mean to tell me that all this is true?”</p>

<p>“True? <em>True?</em> Every blessed word of it.
I then tried to ’list, but couldn’t pass the medical.
So I got another pal and started as a
tomato-johnny in Guernsey. We’re Guernsey
people, you know,” he added, his voice taking
a different intonation. “I’ve a certain affection
for it, too; there I’ll hope to lay these carious
old bones of mine when I’ve done with them.
Mighty poor crops they’ll make, too. Well, I
thought Guernsey, being my own, my native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
land, might be a sort of all-inclusive mascot for
me. But, Lord bless you, sonny, it rained
thunderbolts! Give you my word, no sooner
were our glass-houses up than there arrived a
record shower of aerolites; sticky, shiny, black
things they were, for all the world like liquorice.
Two-thirds of the panes went. As I didn’t
want to wreck the bosom friend’s boat, we
dissolved partnership, and Jonah went off on
his own.”</p>

<p>Farquhar could himself corroborate this
story; he remembered the meteoric shower,
which had attracted some attention.</p>

<p>“The stars in their courses came out of them
to fight against me, you see. Well, I went
back to town and held horses. I fared sumptuously
every day at coffee-stalls, or at Lockhart’s
when I was in funds. I draw a veil over
this period. I was submerged. Then, in hospital,
I met a very decent fellow who got me a
berth in Miss Inez Montroni’s travelling company,
where I lived gaily on a pound a week
till that memorable Sawbath which I broke by
knocking up. I was discovered by a kind angel:
adsum. Are you insured against fire?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid of ill-luck!” said Farquhar.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you, now? I detect a kind of arrogance,
a sort of healthy scepticism in your tone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
my friend. I wonder what you are afraid of?
Not much, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Was your ill-health hereditary?” asked
Farquhar, who as a temperance advocate
studied the question of transmission.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. My parents died ere I was
born, and never saw their son, you see. I inherited
my bad luck, anyway.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t depressed your spirits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe in letting trouble beat

<p>“You talk as though trouble were a living

<p>“So it is; a force inimical, to be conquered,

<p>“I don’t see how you’re going to conquer
trouble. It has its way, and that’s all.”</p>

<p>“It’s not all. Trouble will make a man despair,
or drink, or gamble, or go mad, or maybe
even shoot himself. Well, I’d defy it to
make me deflect a hair’s-breadth from myself,
come all the shafts of fate. As long as I’ve
lips I’ll grin.”</p>

<p>“That’s how you take things?” said Farquhar.
“Well, it’s not my way.” His face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
lighted up with a heady defiance, his lips shut
in a straight line, his eyes sparkled with quite
unregenerate fire.</p>

<p>“What is your way, then?”</p>

<p>Farquhar’s expression went instantly out,
and he lowered his eyelids. “Well, you know,
things are different for you and me,” he said,
diffidently. “I’m lucky in having a religious
faith to fall back on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>do</em> like you!” said Lucian, after a few
seconds, smitten with an admiration which was
not wholly admirable. He solemnly stretched
out his hand. “Sonny, you’re a great man,”
he declared. “I wish I had your cheek.
Shake!”</p>

<p>Farquhar smiled politely, deprecated the
compliment, and evaded the point at issue;
and shortly afterwards conveyed himself out
of the room on the plea that the invalid had
done enough talking. It was fortunate for him
that the language of the eye cannot be put in as
evidence, for Lucian knew that he had detected,
in Farquhar’s too candid orbs, a tacit acknowledgment
of all the deceit wherewith he was desirous
of charging him.</p>

<p>Next morning in country and city men awoke
to a white, silent world under a dome of blue,
immaculate sky. There was no wind; and the
breath of horse and rider hung still in the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
after Noel Farquhar as he rode up to Burnt
House. A huge sweep of bare, white country
lay outspread, sparkling in the sun; the hedges
were so thickly thatched with snow that they
did not break the even whiteness of the prospect.
The miserable little group of black, wooden cottages,
Farquhar’s goal, was discernible a great
way off; they were so lonely that when Farquhar
rode back an hour later only his own
tracks, black where the crushed snow had
melted, confronted him upon the road.</p>

<p>The day passed, and several beside, and a
week later the soiled rags of the snow still lingered
under hedges and by tussocks in the fields
when Farquhar took another morning ride,
this time in the direction of Fanes. The house
lay low; its E-shaped façade, built of bright-red
brick and ornamented with facings of freestone,
and with diagonal bands of dark brown
crossing one another, looked across shaven lawns
and wide gravel paths to a stream formally
laid out with cascades and little islands, in
summer bright with roses. Some noble trees
sprang from the lawn; in particular, a most
beautiful silver birch, whose slight, tapering
branches sustained a colony of ragged black
blots, which were the nests of the rooks of Fanes.
The birds took toll from all the orchards around,
and were almost as well hated as their owners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Fane had a thin, tall figure, with stooping
shoulders and forward-thrusting head. A
pair of keen, cold eyes looked suspiciously forth
from under penthouse brows; self-sufficiency had
compressed his lips, selfish study had hollowed
his cheeks, and his thin, even voice, precise in
enunciation even to pedantry, was the true index
of a steadfastly unamiable character. The
Fanes enjoyed great unpopularity; father, son,
and daughter, they were all shunned like lepers.
Old Fane had married abroad; no one heard his
wife’s maiden name, and when he came back
as a widower nobody cared to ask. The two
children grew up as they would. The son,
Bernard, was notoriously a poacher; the daughter
was a beauty, a wild rider, untutored and
untamed, and shared, so it was said, her brother’s
heinous crimes in the preserves. It was this
business which shut off the young Fanes from
the society of their peers. Once in past years
they had made their appearance at the first
meet of the season, but they never went again;
and thenceforward avoided society more scrupulously
than society avoided them.</p>

<p>All this happened before Noel Farquhar came
to The Lilacs. He had more than once tried
to make friends with young Fane, and had been
snubbed for his pains; and thus to this hour
matters stood. Nobody knew much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
them, but they possessed a fearsome reputation,
which caused nervous ladies to skip
nimbly over fences when they saw Bernard
Fane approaching on his big black
horse.</p>

<p>Eumenes Fane received in his library, a long,
low room walled with books. One case held
tier on tier of novels in their native French,
both old and new; another was devoted to
theology, and put a row of Blair’s most unchristian
sermons across the middle shelf as a
gilded breastplate against the assaults of modern
heresies. Mr. Fane was a ferocious Calvinist;
he felt it his duty to go in for hell, and wished
to exact consent in the same beliefs from his
children, his servants, and in ever-widening circles
from the ends of the earth. Over the mantel
hung an interesting old design in black and
white, which represented the Last Day: a small
queue of saints in stained-glass attitudes ascending
the celestial mountains under the convoy
of woolly angels, a large corps of sinners
being haled out of their tombs by demons
armed with three-pronged spears, which they
used as toasting-forks. His Satanic Majesty
was gleefully directing their operations, amid
tongues of realistic flame. On the card-board
mount of the picture the following verse was
inscribed in youthful round-hand:</p>

<p>The signature seemed to indicate that Mr.
Fane was not always implicitly obeyed by his
children.</p>

<p>He remained sitting when Farquhar was announced,
and looked as forbidding as possible.
Farquhar bowed, and looked as pleasant as
possible. The interview promised to be unconventional.</p>

<p>“You are Noel Farquhar?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name, sir,” said Farquhar, always
particularly respectful to an elderly man.</p>

<p>“You write to me that you have made some
alterations in my cottages at Burnt House,”
continued old Fane, referring to a letter in his
hand.</p>

<p>“I have, sir; and I hope you will forgive my
officiousness in acting without your leave.”</p>

<p>“I understand that you have put in a copper.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t damaged the property; I’ll answer
for that; and it was pretty badly wanted.
If you’d looked at the place yourself—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Where is the copper set?”</p>

<p>“As a lean-to on the last house.”</p>

<p>“What are the dimensions?”</p>

<p>Farquhar supplied him with precise particulars.
“I happened to hear the story from
one of your tenants, and I ordered the thing
at once, without a thought of the landlord’s
right in the matter. When I did remember, it
was too late; the work was begun. I can assure
you, sir, that it actually adds to the value
of the property.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. What should you say at
a guess is the rental worth of the improvement?”</p>

<p>“Oh, something very small; not more than
sixpence a week, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fane made an entry in his book. “Thank
you; I am much obliged to you. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“You’ll overlook my indiscretion?”</p>

<p>“Overlook it? Indiscretion? I am a poor
man, and you have put into my pocket three
shillings a week, Mr. Farquhar; I am greatly
indebted to you.”</p>

<p>“I have put into your pocket three shillings
a week?”</p>

<p>“The additional rent of the six houses, you
understand.”</p>

<p>“You mean to raise the rent?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly. Indiscriminate charity is against
my principles.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, they’ll never be able to pay it.”</p>

<p>“I shall, I hope, find other tenants who
will.”</p>

<p>“And the charity is mine, Mr. Fane.”</p>

<p>“And the houses are mine, Mr. Farquhar.
Would you be so good as to let yourself out?
The men are out on the farm. You cannot
well miss your way.”</p>

<p>Farquhar took up his hat and retired. He
really could not attempt to argue the matter,
and was aware that he had been neatly outwitted.
So great a philanthropist should have
been saddened by thoughts of the Searles, victims
of his blunder; but Noel Farquhar, as he
walked down the hall, was smiling, in candid
appreciation of the nice precision of his defeat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Ere he was able to let himself out, however,
he was recalled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Noel Farquhar!”</p>

<p>Farquhar turned, and saw on the stairs a girl
with a small head and a crown of chestnut hair.
She came leisurely down with her hand on the
balustrade, planting each foot lightly but with
decision; her gait was very characteristic. The
light was from behind and left her features
dark. When she had reached the hall, “I
want to speak to you,” said she, calmly; “please
to come in here.”</p>

<p>Farquhar held his peace and followed her
into another low room, littered with more books
and with Miss Fane’s somewhat masculine appurtenances—a
pair of dogskin gloves, a hard
felt hat, and a riding-whip among them. Armorial
bearings were carved upon the lintel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
traced again in silver upon the uprights of the
andirons, across which logs were lying, in primitive
style. The girl went first to the fire and
stooped to warm her hands before she confronted
him.</p>

<p>“Have you been talking to my father?”</p>

<p>“Am I speaking to Miss Fane?”</p>

<p>“Of course; why do you ask such a question
as that?”</p>

<p>“Because I really was not sure; I thought
you were younger.”</p>

<p>“Most people know us by sight, though we
are too wicked to be received,” returned Miss
Fane, indifferently. “I don’t know whether
you mistook me for a servant. However, that
doesn’t matter; have you been speaking to my
father?”</p>

<p>“I came by appointment on a business matter,
Miss Fane.”</p>

<p>“About those cottages at Burnt House. You
should have written to my brother Bernard; he
manages the farm, and he is reasonable to deal
with. Does my father mean to raise the rents?”</p>

<p>“He said such was his intention, but I hope
he will think better of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, he won’t. Are you going to acquiesce,
and let your protégés be evicted?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly make Mr. Fane lower the rents,
can I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>“You could make up the difference yourself.”</p>

<p>As this was precisely what Farquhar had
determined to do, he was, of course, struck by
her intelligence. But he did his alms in modest
secrecy. “I dare say they will find the extra
sixpence,” he said.</p>

<p>“They can’t. Searle drinks, and the others
are as bad, or worse. They’re helpless.”</p>

<p>Farquhar did not answer her. She had just
moved into the sunlight, and he was startled
by her beauty. No flower-loveliness was hers,
delicate and evanescent; she glowed like a jewel
with colour, the brighter for the sunlight which
illumined the rich damask of her cheeks, the
rich whiteness of her brow, the rich hazel of her
eyes, the rich chestnut of her hair. Dolly Fane
possessed in its full splendour the misnamed
devil’s beauty, the beauty of colour, vitality,
youth. Her lips were virginally severe, her
figure slight, girlishly formed, not yet mature;
she was not so old, nor yet so self-possessed, as
she wished to appear.</p>

<p>“Well, if you are giving in there is no more
to be said,” she added, with a slight contemptuous
movement which was plainly a prelude
to showing him out.</p>

<p>Farquhar hastily cast to the winds his modest
reserve. “I am not giving in; I do mean
to make up the difference,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>“You do?” said Dolly, fastening her eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>“You’re very charitable, Miss Fane,” said
Farquhar, smiling.</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I am sorry for Mrs.
Searle; but I did not ask you for that reason.
I wanted to see what you are like. You’ve
spoken to my brother Bernard once or twice,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I have; but he did not seem interested in
my conversation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Bernard’s way; he always thinks
people mean to patronise him. You know
London well, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lived a good deal in town, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Should I pass muster in society?”</p>

<p>“Pass muster?” Farquhar repeated. It was
not easy to abash him, but this young beauty,
with her odd questions, contrived to do it.</p>

<p>“Yes. I know I am behaving in an unusual
way now, but have I the accent and the appearance
of a lady?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly you have.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? Should I get on in
town? Do you think I am sufficiently presentable
to be an actress?”</p>

<p>“An <em>actress</em>? Yes, I should say you were.”</p>

<p>“You’ve not seen me act, of course; I can
do it. And I’ve a passable voice, and I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
fairly good-looking. Books say that theatre-goers
will put up with poor acting for the sake
of a pretty face; is that true?”</p>

<p>“It depends on the prettiness of the face.
It would be true in your case.”</p>

<p>“I don’t in the least want compliments. I
want the plain truth.”</p>

<p>“And I’m giving it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dolly, evidently disconcerted.
He had checked her for the minute, and she
remained silent, though fresh questions were
at her very lips.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of acting?” Farquhar asked,
to loosen her tongue. “Are you burning to
play Juliet?”</p>

<p>“Juliet? Oh no! I’d like to be Cleopatra
or Lady Macbeth, though. Some one powerful
and perhaps wicked; but not like La Dame
aux Camélias, or Iris, or Agnes Ebbsmith. If
<em>I</em> threw the Bible in the fire, I should keep it
there.”</p>

<p>“And make it eternal, and make it red-hot,”
suggested Farquhar.</p>

<p>“Did you read those lines? Aren’t they
good? Years ago I wrote them there, and
father never could make me rub them out,
though he tried with his riding-whip. But that
wouldn’t interest you. On your honour, do
you think I should have a chance on the stage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<p>“On my honour, I do. But why do you want
to go? I should have thought you’d too much
sense to be stage-struck.”</p>

<p>“I’m not stage-struck, but I want to leave
this place, and that seems the simplest way.
We are badly off. I never see any one except
my brother. I do not know how to behave.
I have never had the chance of speaking to a
gentleman before: which was why I called you
in and asked you these questions. I expect no
girl you know would have done it, would she?”</p>

<p>“You’re right—she wouldn’t; the more fool
she, if she wanted the answer as badly as you
did.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Dolly; “for, after all, it
doesn’t matter what you think of me.”</p>

<p>Farquhar slightly altered his whole bearing.
He leaned against the chimney-piece and looked
her in the face. “My opinion does matter,
you know,” he said. “I’ve some influence,
which I could use either to promote or to frustrate
your interests. I know plenty managers,
and so forth, and I’m popular.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter,” Dolly corrected swiftly;
“for I would under no circumstances consent
to be beholden to you for anything beyond the
piece of truth you’ve already given me.”</p>

<p>“You’re independent.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“I’d much like to teach you to obey.”</p>

<p>“Mathematicians have always wanted to
square the circle.”</p>

<p>“You’ve a will of your own; you’re worth
talking to.”</p>

<p>“Is this how a gentleman speaks to a lady?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s how a man speaks to a woman.”</p>

<p>Dolly glanced out of the window. “That’s
my brother Bernard with his dogs. He stands
six foot three, and he’s the best wrestler in
Kent.”</p>

<p>“Meaning you’d set him to turn me out?
He’d never do it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’re as strong as Bernard?”</p>

<p>“Stronger,” answered Farquhar, stretching
out his arm. Pride of strength was in that
gesture, and more than pride—arrogance.</p>

<p>Dolly had a primitive admiration for strength,
and his self-confidence tingled through her
veins. She liked him the better that he was
dangerous to handle; she was more at her ease
that they were outside convention.</p>

<p>“At least, you’re not stronger than Bernard
plus half a dozen men whom I could call in a
minute,” she remarked, evenly. “Wouldn’t it
be wiser to make no fuss, but go?”</p>

<p>Farquhar started, passed his hand across his
eyes, and looked at her earnestly, as though
her words had wakened him. “Miss Fane, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
believe I’ve been saying the most outrageous
things!” he exclaimed. “Haven’t I? I don’t
know what possessed me. What have I said?”</p>

<p>“A little harmless nonsense, that’s all,”
Dolly assured him.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to forgive me. To tell the
truth, I’d a touch of sunstroke out in Africa,
and since then I’m not my own master at times.
I’m literally out of my wits. I don’t know
what I’ve said, but nothing was farther from
my mind than any rudeness to you—to any
lady. You will believe that?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You won’t punish me by declining to speak
to me?”</p>

<p>“We aren’t likely to meet. Your friends
don’t know me.”</p>

<p>“We shall meet, if you allow it. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Will I, now?” said Dolly. She went and
threw open the door. “Good-morning.”</p>

<p>Farquhar pleaded, but his words were wasted.
Not a word more would Miss Fane say, and at
last he took up his hat and walked out.</p>

<p>When she had watched him out of sight, Dolly
went bareheaded across the lawn to a tool-shed
under the trees, round which circled a numerous
company of dogs, ranging from a smart
terrier up to a huge grave brute, half bloodhound,
half Great Dane, of the breed which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Virginian planters used in the good old days for
tracking down their runaway slaves. Within,
Dolly found the tall young fellow whom she had
pointed out to Farquhar. He was darker than
his sister, and not so handsome, but the two
were plainly slips of the same tree. Bernard’s
manners needed attention. When his sister appeared
he did not lay down his saw, which produced
an ear-piercing rasping and ratching such
as denied conversation. Dolly put her hand
on his and arrested his work by force.</p>

<p>“Well, what did that chap Farquhar want?”
asked Bernard, without resentment.</p>

<p>Dolly related Farquhar’s doings at Burnt
House, and the sequel. Bernard’s comment
was: “I guess he must be an ass,” and he took
up his saw to resume work, but was once more
summarily stopped by his sister. These incidents
were stages in the conversation; as people
of quick wits often do when they live together,
these two were in the habit of expressing
themselves by signs.</p>

<p>“He’s going to pay the difference himself, and
not let father know,” Dolly explained.</p>

<p>“Then I guess he’s only a soft. But how did
you hear?”</p>

<p>“I called him into the parlour and asked. I
asked him whether I should succeed on the
stage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>A pause, during which Bernard framed, and
discarded as useless, a reproof. “What did
he say?”</p>

<p>“He said I should.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see you can count that. I guess it
wouldn’t be good manners for him to tell you
you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“He did mean it. He wasn’t particularly
polite.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing actually rude. It was odd,”
said Dolly, reflectively. “At first he was—oh,
Bernard, you know what I mean: turned
out on a pattern and polished, like all the other
gentlemen we’ve seen. I <em>was</em> rather nervous;
but I meant to go through with it. Then his
manner seemed to break in half. He was almost
brutal. I must say I rather liked that;
it was raw nature. And quite at the end he
apologised, and said that he’d had sunstroke
in Africa. Do you think that likely to be
true?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say,” said Bernard. “I know
he’s been in Africa.”</p>

<p>“What! out at the front? How painfully
ordinary!”</p>

<p>“You do it very well,” said Bernard, with
admiration. “That was just like the woman
in the black frills at Merton’s. You’d soon be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
as good as they are. Farquhar wasn’t volunteering,
though; he was up farther north, where
they get miasma.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dolly, leaning her elbows on the
bench and her chin on her clasped hands.
“Do you like him, Bernie?”</p>

<p>“Not if he was rude to you; though I guess
swells generally are cads, like in books.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t exactly rude. He was primitive.
I should say he was very strong, and
rather wicked, and subtle; not like us. We’re
quite simple, simplex, one-fold; we mean what
we say and do what we mean, you and I.”</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” said Bernard, who was
not troubled by uncertain ethics.</p>

<p>“Noel Farquhar doesn’t, then; I’m sure of
it. He is very strong. He says he is stronger
than you are.”</p>

<p>Bernard stretched out a brawny arm. “He’s
six inches shorter, anyway. At that rate he’d
have to be a Hercules to lick me.”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to wrestle with him. I’d like
to see him thrown.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Dolly!”</p>

<p>“And I mean to meet him again.”</p>

<p>“I know that isn’t the proper thing. You
ought to get introduced first.”</p>

<p>“I can take care of myself. He interests
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll be falling in love with him if you
don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“That I never should do. But he might
fall in love with me.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t think that was likely.”</p>

<p>“Why not? We Fanes are as good a family
as any in England. And I’m handsome: Bernard,
you said I was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you aren’t like the woman in the
black frills,” said Bernard, measuring his sister
by the only standard of taste he knew. “Besides,
I guess Merton’s morally sure you were
out poaching last time with me, and he and
Farquhar are as thick as thieves. Girls oughtn’t
to poach.”</p>

<p>“There are some people who don’t class
that among the seven deadly sins, and he’s
one; I know it. He has wild blood, as we
have.”</p>

<p>“But would you marry him if he wanted
you to?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure. I might. He could give
me what I want—experience.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you aren’t contented here,”
said Bernard, bending to his work again.</p>

<p>“I dare say not,” retorted Dolly, pacing the
shed. “You’re phlegmatic. You’re content
with the rind of life. Bitter or sweet, I mean
to taste the core.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<p>“I expect, you know, you’ll come to awful
grief.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But so I’ve lived my life first,
I’ll not complain.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bernard, “I never saw you in
heroics before, and I guess I don’t care if I
never do again.”</p>

<p>Then he returned to his work, and drowned
Dolly’s aspirations in the harsh duet of squeaking
saw and dissentient wood.</p>

<span class="fs80">SHE GOES ON SUNDAY TO THE CHURCH</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Eumenes Fane’s marriage had been both
more respectable and more romantic than
his kind enemies believed: living in Paris, he
had eloped with a handsome, wilful French girl
of noble family. Her relations swallowed the
match as a bitter pill, his did not exist; and
the married lovers lived in isolation far away
in Brittany until death cut short their long
honeymoon. Eumenes returned to England
embittered; he had always been disagreeable.
The relations between him and his children
were eccentric. He lived with them, he had
taught them, yet he lavished satire upon their
boorishness and stupidity; he had been devoted
to the mother, yet for the children he had no
feeling but unamiable contempt. They, on
their part, repaid him with indifference. Bernard
at eighteen, on his own initiative, took
control of the farm and made it pay; Dolly
managed the dairy and the household. Their
lives were isolated equally from their father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and from the world. Bernard was not much
of a reader, and never strayed far from his
Shakespeare and his farming journals, with
excursions into Tennyson; but Dolly was insatiable.
She had read and digested every
book in their heterogeneous library. Unfortunately,
the collection was not representative;
the modern French novelists were there arranged
in full tale, and fresh volumes were added
as they appeared, but it had no single work
of English fiction later than the date of the admirable
<em>Sir Charles Grandison</em>. Both Bernard
and Dolly could read and speak French as easily
as English, though they did not know the
worth of their accomplishment; and from their
study of fin-de-siècle literature they had gained
an innocently lurid knowledge of the world
which hardly fitted in with the conditions of
English country life, and was particularly inappropriate
as applied to the blameless households
at the vicarage, the surgery, or The Lilacs.
When young Merton of The Hall brought home
a pretty bride, Dolly seriously looked for the
appearance of Tertium Quid. He delayed his
coming for a year, and then arrived in the
cradle. Dolly was surprised; but she ascribed
this breach of custom to the fact that Merton
senior’s money was made in soap. Only the
true aristocrats indulge in a friend of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>After Farquhar’s visit Dolly made a dress
for herself. It was then the fashion to wear
a bodice opening at the sleeves and in front to
show a lighter under-dress, which also appeared
beneath the skirt, as the corolla of a flower beneath
the calyx. Dolly’s gown of dark chestnut
matched her hair; the colour of the vest was
white. She was more skilful in the dairy than
with her needle, but she gave her mind to this,
and in the end her work was crowned with fair
success.</p>

<p>“I guess that colour, what they call, suits
you,” said Bernard, whom she called in to assist
at the full-dress rehearsal.</p>

<p>“I expect it does,” assented Dolly, bending
back her swan’s-neck to catch a glimpse of her
supple young waist in the spotty mirror. “It
fits rather badly; any one can see it is homemade,
but that can’t be helped. I am going
to wear it to church on Christmas Day.”</p>

<p>“Father’ll be awfully angry if you go to
church.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but that doesn’t matter. No
one except small shopkeepers and mill-girls
goes to chapel now. Besides, the minister
drops his h’s and mixes his metaphors and
talks the silliest nonsense: I wouldn’t listen to
him even if it were the fashion. Shall you
come with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p>“I guess I’d better. Have you seen that
Farquhar chap again?”</p>

<p>“I have,” Dolly answered, composedly.</p>

<p>“You’ll get yourself into a mess if you don’t
look out.”</p>

<p>“Oh no. He may get into a mess, but I shall
not.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t think you are playing fair.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. He knows why I spoke to
him.”</p>

<p>“Why did you?”</p>

<p>“To know how ladies behave.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll go your own way,” said
Bernard, after a pause; “but people’ll talk if
you go on meeting him.”</p>

<p>“Let them. I don’t mean to stay down
here.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Bernard.</p>

<p>Dolly perceived the force of this objection.
She valued Farquhar’s advice; but where her
own aims clashed with Bernard’s well-being,
she rarely hesitated.</p>

<p>“Very well; I won’t meet him again,” she
said. “But, Bernard, if he speaks to you, do
you respond. Ask him here; no one can find
fault if I see him in my own house. Or I
don’t think they can; do you?”</p>

<p>She was reassured by Bernard’s hearty assent,
backed by a special instance. “For,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
said he, “when Maude had his sister staying
here, Farquhar went and saw them; and I
guess if he goes to Maude’s house he can come
to us.” And the point was thus settled.</p>

<p>Two days before Christmas the wind blew
softly from the south, the snow melted from
the earth and the clouds from the sky, the
robins broke out into their pure celestial strains,
and it was spring in all but name. Farquhar’s
invalid began to pester his doctor for permission
to go out, and Dolly got a white hat to go with
her <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: chestnut gown" id="tn-1">chestnut gown.</ins></p>

<p>Christmas Day itself was a flash of summer.
Dolly came down dressed for church at half-past
ten, and found her brother ready in a
Norfolk jacket, knickerbockers, and a cap.
An inward monitor told her that this attire
was incorrect, and she said so; but as Bernard
had nothing else to wear, the question <i lang="la">solvitur
ambulando</i>.</p>

<p>Neither of them had ever been to church.
In early days Bernard had been sent to a chapel
with a damnatory creed, and he took his sister
with him till she developed opinions of her
own: an epoch early in Dolly’s history. She
rebelled: Bernard, who was bored by the service,
outraged by the music, and submissive
only from indifference, supported her: and Mr.
Fane’s graceless children took their own way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and henceforth spent the Sabbath hours in
reading, prefaced always by a chapter of the
Bible.</p>

<p>They arrived late, having lingered in the
woods because Dolly said, and Bernard agreed,
that Mrs. Merton and the lady in the black
frills had never entered the church till after
the bells stopped ringing. Such is the force
of bad example. Bernard held the door open
for his sister, and followed her in, according to
instructions which he had received from her,
and she from Noel Farquhar. The aisles were
crossed by dim sunbeams swimming with
drowsy motes, the people were sleepy, the priest
was monotoning monotonously out of tune; and
Dolly’s entrance, in company with a beam of
pure sunshine and a gust of wind which set the
Christmas wreaths rustling all round the church,
electrified everybody. Heads turned to stare;
the choristers, ever the devotees of inattention,
nudged and whispered. Up the aisle came
Dolly, a glowing piece of colour in her rich dress
and richer hair, with the immaculate whiteness
of her brow and the deepening carmine of her
cheeks, her eyes shining like brown diamonds.
She walked steadily, carrying her head high,
up to the big square pew assigned by tradition
to the house of Fanes, unlatched the door, and
took her seat. Bernard followed, his height<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and his patent unconcern making his figure
quite as imposing as hers.</p>

<p>For a space Dolly knelt, as she saw others
doing, and hid her hot face; but when the time
came she rose, and pinched Bernard, who had
sat down and stayed there. He got up slowly,
plunged his hands into his pockets, and looked
round him. Dolly was convinced that his behaviour
was improper; she also looked round
her, but without moving her head, and found
her exemplar in the person of Noel Farquhar,
who was attentively following the service in a
large prayer-book. Three volumes lay on the
shelf of their pew; Dolly opened one and handed
another to her brother, signing to him to do
his duty. He looked into it helplessly; it was
a copy of <cite>Hymns Ancient and Modern</cite>, and it
is not surprising that he could not find the
place. Dolly was no better off, but she had a
model to imitate; she turned over the pages as
though they were perfectly familiar, found her
place near the beginning of the volume, and
devoutly studied the evening hymns while the
choristers chanted the Venite.</p>

<p>The recollection of that morning always
brought a smile to Dolly’s lips. Occupied by
her culte of deportment, and still more by her
culte of Bernard’s deportment, she missed the
humours at the moment, but found them all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
more amusing under the enchantment lent by
distance. Bernard, who was not thinking
about himself, was not amused. Music at
chapel had been bad enough, but this, more
ambitious, was really horrible. The choir sang
neither better nor worse than most village performers;
there was a preponderance of trebles
out of tune and raucous, an absence of altos,
two tenors who sang wrong, and three basses
who sang treble. When they should have monotoned
they climbed unevenly and one by one
in linked sweetness long drawn out down a
chromatic scale, until Bernard suddenly launched
the true note at them in a voice of startling
richness and power, which would have made
his fortune had he taken it to market in town.
It had the true bass quality, but an unusually
extensive compass, ranging from the C below
the bass clef up to the octave of middle C.</p>

<p>After he began to sing, most of the curious
eyes were diverted from Dolly to him, and she
regained her composure. Farquhar had not
looked at her; it was not his cue to let his eye
wander during service. But Dolly was sure,
from the dark flush which overspread his face,
that he had seen her enter. She designed this
meeting as a test. If he refused to acknowledge
her before his friends, Dolly vowed that
she would never speak to him again. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
pride of birth was keen; she went to the length
of thinking her brother the only gentleman
present, inasmuch as he alone, so far as she
knew, had the right to bear arms. She took
little part in the religious ceremonies. Dolly
had her creed, and held to it in practice, but
at this time she was too intent on this world to
think much of the next.</p>

<p>She got up with alacrity after the benediction,
and marshalled out Bernard, glad to go.
The organist was now playing music soft and
slow, and tenderly touching the pedals with
boots so large that he frequently put down two
notes at once by accident. Music was really
the only subject about which Bernard was sensitive;
as a false quantity to a Latinist, as a
curse to a Quaker, as a red rag to a bull, so was
a wrong note to Bernard Fane.</p>

<p>Outside shone the sun and breathed the
wind and danced the grasses over the graves
of women as young and beautiful as Dolly;
but she was not thinking of them. The stream
of people began to condense into groups of two
and three, who gave each other the accustomed
greetings and echoed cheerful wishes at cross
purpose in a babel of inanity. Farquhar was
shaking hands with Mrs. Merton, a fragile little
lady with dark eyes, <em>frileuse</em>, as Dolly christened
her, who dressed very well and talked plaintive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
nonsense in an erratic fashion. Dolly knew by
instinct that they were speaking of her. She
went on at an even pace. Farquhar broke
from his friends and followed, and Dolly, with
true Christmas good-will in her heart, found
herself shaking his hand in the overhand style,
according to the custom of the lady in black
frills.</p>

<p>“I wish I could walk home your way; I’ve a
hundred things to say about that Burnt House
business, and one never has a chance of seeing
Mr. Fane. But I’ve an invalid at home who’s
to take his first airing to-day, and I know he’ll
go too far if I don’t look after him.”</p>

<p>“Is that the chap you picked up on the
road?” asked Bernard, who had heard the story
from the men, with romantic embellishments.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t pick him up; don’t think it; he
was planted on me by Providence. I say, Fane,
if you’ve nothing better to do, I wish you’d
come in to-night and have a knock-up at billiards.
It would be a Christian act, for I’ve
not a soul in the house except the invalid, who
toddles off to bye-bye at seven.”</p>

<p>“I can’t play billiards,” was Bernard’s reply,
rather proudly spoken.</p>

<p>“Right; I’ll teach you. There’s nothing
I like better; is there, Mrs. Merton?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me; I never pretend to fathom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
you,” said Mrs. Merton, plaintively, shaking
her head. And she put out a very small hand
to Dolly. “Please don’t snub me, Miss Fane;
I’d so like to come and call, if you’ll let me.
I was told you were a dreadful person, who
dropped the h and divided the hoof—skirt, I
mean; besides, it was your turn to call first on
me. But you aren’t dreadful, are you? So
may I come?”</p>

<p>Had there been any patronage in Mrs. Merton’s
manner, Dolly would have been delighted
to snub her; but there was none. The formula
of gracious acceptance was less easy than a refusal,
but Dolly let no one guess her difficulties.
An interesting general discussion of the weather
followed, during which one remarked that it
gave the doctors quite a holiday, a second that
it was muggy and unwholesome and why didn’t
we have a nice healthy frost, a third that it was
excellent for the crops, and a fourth that the
harvest would be certainly ruined by wireworms,
and each agreed with all the rest. Bernard,
standing still, thought fashionable people
talked like imbeciles. Dolly, shy, though no
one saw it, was in a glow of triumph.</p>

<p>Their way home led through woods. So much
rain had fallen that the mossy bridle-path was
scored with deep ruts full of water, and Dolly
had to hold her skirt away from the black leaf-mould.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Rain-drops held in crumpled copper
leaves shone gemlike, smooth young stems
glistened; only the grey boles of the forest
trees looked warm and dry. Dolly, herself
like a russet leaf, harmonised with the woodland
scenery, which seemed a frame made for
her.</p>

<p>Farther on down the path, resignedly sitting
on a bundle of fagots, and beginning to grow
chilly, Lucian de Saumarez was waiting for
some one to pass. He had set out with the
virtuous intention of returning home in half
an hour precisely, but had been lured on by
a shrew-mouse, a squirrel, and the enchanting
sun, till the end of his strength put a period to
his walk; his legs gave way under him. Then
he sat down and whistled “Just Break the
News to Mother,” very cheerfully. It was
fortunate that in Bernard’s hearing he did not
attempt to sing, for his voice can only be described
by the adjective squawky. He looked
like a tramp who had stolen a coat, for over his
own he wore one of Farquhar’s, which was
truly a giant’s robe to him. At first glimpse
of Dolly he whipped off his cap, and stood up
bareheaded and recklessly polite.</p>

<p>“Excuse me—” he began.</p>

<p>“If you want relief, you’d better go to Alresworth
workhouse; they’ll take you in there,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
interrupted Bernard, who would never give to
tramps.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Bernard. Is there anything we
can do for you?” asked Dolly, in her gentlest
voice.</p>

<p>“Candidly, I only ask an arm, and not an
alms,” said Lucian, laughing in Bernard’s face.
“Fact is, I’ve walked up from The Lilacs and
just petered out. Your woods are such a very
remarkably long way through.”</p>

<p>“Then your name is De Saumarez. Bernard,
give Mr. de Saumarez your arm. You must
come home with us and rest; afterwards you
can go back. You ought not to be sitting
down out-of-doors this weather,” said Dolly,
fixing her imperious young eyes upon him, between
pity and severity.</p>

<p>“No, I’m an abomination, I confess it,” answered
the culprit, meekly.</p>

<p>“You must be feeling very tired.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling more like boned goose than
anything else, especially in the legs. By-the-way,
I wonder if Farquhar will leave his to
look for the strayed lamb?”</p>

<p>“Let him; it won’t do him any harm.”</p>

<p>Lucian’s eyes opened wide; Farquhar had
described the ladies of Monkswell in picture-making
phrases, and he was trying to fit this
vivid young beauty into some one of the frames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
provided, which all seemed too strait. “Am
I speaking to Miss Maude?” he asked at a
venture, choosing the likeliest.</p>

<p>“Oh no. I am Mirabelle Fane, and this is
my brother Bernard.”</p>

<p>“The dickens you are!” said Lucian to himself;
for Farquhar, in relating the adventure of Mr.
Fane and the copper, had not mentioned Miss
Fane. Her foreign name and intonation caught
Lucian’s ear, and he asked if she were French.</p>

<p>“My mother was Comtesse de Beaufort,”
Dolly told him, and her naïve pride was quaint
and pretty. Lucian mentioned Paris, and she
fastened upon him with a string of eager questions,
but put him to silence before half were answered,
by declaring that he had talked too
much.</p>

<p>“I’ve been off the silent list this fortnight
past,” Lucian pleaded.</p>

<p>“But you are already overtired. You ought
to lie down directly you get in, and take a dose
of cod-liver oil.”</p>

<p>“I take cod-liver oil three times a day,”
Lucian assured her, with equal gravity.</p>

<p>“How? In port wine?”</p>

<p>“I should consider that a sacrilege. No; I
will describe the operation,” said Lucian, warming
to his subject, which in any of his many conversations
with pretty girls he had never discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
before. “I squeeze half a lemon into a
wineglass, so; then I pour the oil in on it; next
I squeeze the juice of the other half-lemon into
another wineglass; and finally I swallow first
the lemon plus oil and then the lemon solus.
It is a process which requires great nicety
and precision. Farquhar is not so careful as I
could wish. Of course, it is nothing to him if
I suffer.”</p>

<p>“Port wine would be far more nourishing
than lemon-juice,” Dolly asseverated, knitting
her brows. “Or milk would be better. Have
you ever tried goat’s milk?”</p>

<p>“I have not; is it a sovereign specific?”</p>

<p>“I have known it work wonderful cures on
emaciated people. How much do you weigh?”</p>

<p>“Six stone eleven, I believe.”</p>

<p>“That is far too little. You should test
your weight every day—are you laughing at
me?”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry!” said Lucian, who certainly
was. “But, Miss Fane, what a nurse
you would make! I was expecting you to feel
my pulse, and take my temperature, and look
at my tongue.”</p>

<p>“So I was intending to do; I have a clinical
thermometer at home,” Dolly proudly answered.
“I do not know how to behave. I
have never learned any manners.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>“Say you’ve never learned customs; manners
come by nature.”</p>

<p>Lucian’s smile was irresistible.</p>

<p>“Mine come very badly, then,” said Dolly,
smiling back at him; “for when we get in you
will certainly have to lie down; and, what’s
more, I <em>shall</em> give you a glass of goat’s milk.”</p>

<span class="fs80">HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A royal stag, whose many-branched and
palmate antlers showed that he had seen at
least ten springs, looked down upon the mantel-piece
of Noel Farquhar’s library; a huge elk
fronted him across the room. This style of decoration,
which took its origin in the simple skull
palisades of primitive Britain and latter-day
Africa, which was handed down by the traditions
of Tower Hill, and which is rampant in the modern
hall, had in Noel Farquhar a devotee. The
walls of his smoking-room bristled with the
heads of digested enemies. Thither the two
men repaired after dinner on Christmas night,
taking with them a decanter of mid-century
port, cigars of indubitable excellence, and a
dish of nuts for Lucian, who took a childlike
interest in extracting and peeling walnuts
without breaking the kernel. Farquhar was
inclined to be silent, in which mood Lucian, the
student of the abnormal, found him specially
interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Queer chap you are Farquhar,” he suddenly
remarked. “Why didn’t you ever tell
me about the fascinating Fanes?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I? I thought I had.” Farquhar
did not think any such thing, and Lucian knew
it. “The day I went there Miss Dolly Fane
stopped me in the hall, and would know
whether I thought she’d make an actress. An
odd girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what did you say to her?”</p>

<p>“Said she would. I couldn’t do otherwise,
could I?”</p>

<p>“My immaculate friend, I’m afraid the
charms of Miss Fane have persuaded you into
a statement which is very remarkably near to
a L, I, E, lie. At the least, you were disingenuous,
decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Who says I am immaculate? Not I. You
thrust virtues upon me and then cry out when
I don’t come up to your notions of an archangel.”</p>

<p>“And your church-going and your alms-giving
and your brand-new coppers and general
holiness? Eh, sonny?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a creed, as four-fifths of the men down
here are supposed to have; but whereas they
deny in their acts what they repeat with their
tongues, I prefer to perform what I profess.
There’s a fine lack of logic about the way men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
regard their faith; each time they repeat their
Credo they’re self-condemned fools. Well, I
don’t relish making a fool of myself. Either
I’ll be an infidel, and thus set myself free, or
else I’ll act up to what I say. For that you
praise me. Now, the only virtue to which I
do lay claim is patience, of which I think I
possess an extraordinary store.”</p>

<p>Lucian peeled a walnut with painstaking
earnestness, and ate it with salt and pepper.
The shell he flicked across at Farquhar, who
had fallen into a brown study and was looking
very grim. He looked up with a quick, involuntary
smile.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot all these horned beasties
yourself?” Lucian inquired, introducing the
elk and the stag with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>“Yes. I shot the elk in Russia; the horns
weigh a good eighty pounds. Shy brutes they
are, and fierce when at bay; this one lamed me
with a kick after I thought I had done for him.”</p>

<p>“My biggest bag was twenty sjamboks running,”
said Lucian, pensively. “I and some
others were up country on a big shoot, and, of
course, I got fever and had to lie up. Well,
they used to come in with their blesbok and
their springbok, and all the rest of it, so I didn’t
see why I shouldn’t do a little on my own. So
I lined up all our niggers with a sjambok apiece,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and made my bag from my couch of pain. I
worked those sjamboks afterwards for all they
were worth. Yes, sir-ree.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I really think you’re daft, De
Saumarez!”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t mention it. Let’s see, where
were you? Oh, in Russia. No, I’ve never
been there—I don’t know Russia at all.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“What, intimately?”</p>

<p>Farquhar turned his head, met Lucian’s eyes,
and smiled. “Oh no; quite slightly,” he said,
lying with candour and glee.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” said Lucian. “Now that’s
queer; I thought I’d met you there. By the
way, do you believe in eternal constancy?”</p>

<p>“In what?”</p>

<p>“In eternal constancy; did you never hear
of it before?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, pulex irritans, I’ve seen a man go
mourning all his life long; so I do believe in it.”</p>

<p>“No, no, sonny; I’m not discussing its existence,
but its merits. Do you hold that a man
should be eternally faithful to the memory of
a dead woman?”</p>

<p>“Not if he doesn’t want to.”</p>

<p>“My point is that he oughtn’t to want to.
See here; your body changes every seven years,
and I’ll be hanged if your mind doesn’t change,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
too. Now, your married couple change together
and so keep abreast. But if the woman
dies, she comes to a stop. In seven years the
survivor will have grown right away from her.
The constant husband prides himself on his
loyalty, and is ashamed to admit even in camera
that a resurrected wife wouldn’t fit into his
present life; but in nine cases out of ten the
wound’s healed and cicatrised, and only a
sentimental scruple bars him from saying so.
And there, as I take it, he’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“What would you have him do?”</p>

<p>“Take another woman and make her and
himself happy.”</p>

<p>“What becomes of the dead wife’s point of
view?”</p>

<p>“According to my creed, you know, she’s
got no point of view at all.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect me to follow you there.”</p>

<p>“No; and so I’ll cite your own creed. After
the resurrection there shall be no marrying or
giving in marriage. She’s no call to be jealous.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no romance about you.”</p>

<p>“No sentimentalism, you mean. Half the
feelings consecrated by public opinion are trash.
It’s astounding how we do adore the dumps.
Happiness is our first duty. It seems to me
that one needs more courage to forget than to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
remember. That’s where I’ve been weak myself.”</p>

<p>Lucian put his hand inside his coat and took
out the letter which Farquhar had read; he
had been leading up to this point. He spread
it open on his knee, showing the thick, chafed,
blue paper, the gilded monogram and daisy
crest, the thin Italian writing. “I’ve carried
that about for nine years,” he said, glancing up,
and then held the paper to the fire and watched
it catch light. The advancing line of brown,
the blue-edged flame, crept across the letter,
leaving shrivelled ash in its track. Lucian held
it till the heat scorched his fingers, and then
let it fall in the fire. “A passionate letter, was
it not?” he said, turning from the black, rustling
tinder to meet Farquhar’s eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear De Saumarez!”</p>

<p>“Don’t humbug; you read it when you
thought I was unconscious.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Farquhar, “now I understand
why you understood.”</p>

<p>He altered his pose slightly, relaxing as
though freed from some slight, omnipresent
constraint; the nature which confronted Lucian
was different in gross and in detail from
the mask of excellence which he had hitherto
kept on. Vices were there, and virtues unsuspected:
coarse, barbaric, potent qualities, dominated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
by a will-power mightier than they.
Race-characteristics, hitherto overlaid, suddenly
started out; and Lucian, recurring quickly
to the last fresh lie which Farquhar had told
him, exclaimed, “Why, man, you’re a Russian
yourself!”</p>

<p>“Half-breed. My mother was Russian. My
father was Scotch, but a naturalized Russian
subject. The worse for him; he died in the
mines. Confound him: a pretty ancestry he’s
given me, and a pretty job I’ve had to keep the
story out of the papers. I’ve done it, though.”</p>

<p>“But what’s it for?” asked Lucian, whose
mind was flying to the story of Jekyll and Hyde.</p>

<p>“Respectability; that’s the god of England.
Do you think I could confess myself the son of
a couple of dirty Russian nihilists and keep
my position? Not much. It’s the only crevice
in my armour. Scores of men have tried
to get on by shamming virtuous, but I’ve gone
one better than they; I <em>am</em> virtuous. You
can’t pick a hole in my character, because
there’s none to pick. I speak the truth, I do
my duty, I’m honest and honourable down to
the end of the whole fool’s catalogue, I even
go out of my way to be chivalrously charitable,
as when I picked you up, or made a fool of myself
over that confounded copper. That’s all
the political muck-worms find when they come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
burrowing about me. Yes, honesty’s the best
policy; it pays.”</p>

<p>“H’m! well, my most honourable friend,
you’d find yourself in Queer Street if I related
how you’d read my letter.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I was glancing at it to
find your address.”</p>

<p>“You took a mighty long time over your
glance.”</p>

<p>“The paper was so much rubbed that I could
hardly see where it began or ended.”</p>

<p>“There was the monogram for a sign-post.”</p>

<p>“Plenty women begin on the back sheet.”</p>

<p>“You’re abominable; faith, you are,” said
Lucian. “You’re a regular prayer-mill of
lies!”</p>

<p>“I’d never have touched it if I hadn’t prepared
my excuse beforehand. Ruin my career
for the sake of reading an old love-letter?
Not I!”</p>

<p>Even as Farquhar wished it, the contemptuous
and insulting reference displeased Lucian;
the letter was still sacred in his eyes. But he
would not, and he did not, allow the feeling to
be seen. Farquhar’s measure of reserve was
matched by his present openness; but Lucian,
whose affairs were everybody’s business, kept
his mind as a fenced garden and a fountain
sealed. Action and reaction are always equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and opposite; the law is true in the moral as
well as the physical world.</p>

<p>“Kindly speak of my letter with more respect,
will you?” was all Lucian said.</p>

<p>“Oh, the letter was charming; I wish it had
been addressed to me!”</p>

<p>“You shut up, and don’t try to be a profane
and foolish babbler. I want to know what it’s
all for—what’s your aim and object, sonny?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get into the Cabinet.”</p>

<p>“You are, are you?” said Lucian. “And
why not be premier?”</p>

<p>“And why not king? Because I happen to
know my own limitations. I’ll make a damned
good understrapper, but the other’s beyond
me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll change your mind when you’ve got
your wish.”</p>

<p>“And there you’re wrong. I’ll be content
then. I’m content now, for that matter. It’s
as good as a play to see how the virtuous people
look up to me.”</p>

<p>Lucian leaned back in the attitude proper
to meditation, and studied his vis-à-vis over his
joined finger-tips. Strength of body, strength
of mind, a will keen as a knife-blade to cut
through obstacles, an arrogant pride in himself
and his sins, all these had writ themselves
large on Farquhar’s face; but the acute mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of the critic was questing after more amiable
qualities.</p>

<p>“And so you took me in as an instance of
chivalrous charity, eh? And what do you keep
me here for, now I’m sain and safe?”</p>

<p>“You’re not well enough to be dismissed
cured.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I could go and hold
horses to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to find some work for you before
I let you go. I like to do the thing thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“I see. I’m being kept as an object-lesson
in generosity; is that so?”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it,” said Farquhar. “Hope you
like the position. Have a cigar?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I don’t mind being a sandwich-man,
but I draw the line at an object-lesson.”
Lucian got up, and began buttoning
his coat round him. “If that’s your reason
for keeping me, I’m off.”</p>

<p>“De Saumarez, don’t be a fool.”</p>

<p>“I will not be an object-lesson,” said Lucian,
making for the door. “My conscience rebels
against the deception. I will expire on your
threshold.”</p>

<p>Farquhar jumped up and put his back against
the door. “Go and sit down, you fool!”</p>

<p>“I’ve not the slightest intention of sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
down. I will be a body—a demd, damp,
moist, unpleasant body.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean this?”</p>

<p>“I do. I’m too proud to take money from
a man who’s not a friend.”</p>

<p>Farquhar was very angry. He knew what
Lucian wanted, but he would not say it. “Go,
and be hanged to you, then!” he retorted, and
flung round towards the fire.</p>

<p>“All right, I’m <em>going</em>,” said Lucian, as he
went into the hall.</p>

<p>He took his cap and his stick. Overcoat he
had none, and he could not now borrow Farquhar’s.
His own clothes were inadequate even
for mid-day wearing, and for night were absurd.
All this Farquhar knew. He heard Lucian unbolt
and unlock the front door, and presently
the wind swept in, invaded the hall, and made
Farquhar shiver, sitting by the fire. Lucian
coughed.</p>

<p>Up sprang Farquhar; he ran into the hall,
flung the door closed, caught Lucian round
the shoulders, and in the impatient pride of
his strength literally carried him back to the
library close to the fire. “You fool!” he said.
“You dashed fool!”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Lucian, looking up, laughing,
from the sofa upon which he had been cast.
“Own up! Why do you keep me here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Because you have a damnable way of getting
yourself liked. Because you’re sick.”</p>

<p>“Sh! don’t swear like that, sonny; you really
do shock me. And so you like me?”</p>

<p>“I’ve always a respect for people who find
me out,” retorted Farquhar. “The others—Lord,
what fools—what fools colossal! But
you’ve grit; you know your own mind; you do
what you want, and not what your dashed
twopenny-halfpenny passions want. Besides,
you’re ill,” he wound up again, with a change
of tone which sent Lucian’s eyebrows up to his
shaggy hair.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice person for a small Sunday-school!”
was his comment. “Well, well! So
you profess yourself superior to dashed twopenny-halfpenny
passions—such as affection,
for example?”</p>

<p>“I was bound to stop you going. You’d
have died at my door and made a scandal.”</p>

<p>“You know very well that never entered
your head. Take care what you say; I can
still go, you know.”</p>

<p>Farquhar laughed, half angry; he chafed
under Lucian’s control; would fain have denied
it, but could not. “Confound you, I wish I’d
never seen you!” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll wish that more before you’ve done.
I’m safe to bring bad luck. Gimme your hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and I’ll tell your fortune. I can read the palm
like any gypsy; got a drop of Romany blood in
me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not read mine,” said Farquhar, grimly,
putting it out.</p>

<p>“Won’t I? Hullo! You’ve got a nice little
handful!”</p>

<p>The hand was scarred from wrist to finger-tips.</p>

<p>“Never noticed it before, did you? I’m pretty
good at hiding it by now.”</p>

<p>“How on earth was it done?”</p>

<p>“In hell—that’s Africa. I told you I learned
massage from an old Arab sheikh; well, I practised
on him. I was alone and down with fever,
and they don’t have river police on the Lualaba.
He made me his slave. Used to thrash
me when he chose to say I’d not done my work;
make me kneel at his feet and strike me on the
face.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! How did you like that,
sonny?”</p>

<p>“I smiled at him till he got sick of it. Then
he put me on silence: one word, death. He
thought he’d catch me out, but I’d no notion of
that; I held my tongue. So one day the old
devil sent me to fetch his knife. It was dusk,
and I picked it up carelessly; the handle was
white-hot. He’d tried that trick with slaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
before. Liked to see them howl and drop it,
and then finish them off with the very identical
knife—confound him!”</p>

<p>“Amen. And what did you do?”</p>

<p>“I? Brought him his knife by the blade;
do you think I was going to let him cheat me
out of my career?”</p>

<p>Lucian stared at him. “You—you!” he
said. “And I verily believe the man’s telling
the truth. What happened next?”</p>

<p>“Something to do with termites that I won’t
repeat; it might make you ill.”</p>

<p>“Only a channel steamer does that, sonny.
You got away, though?”</p>

<p>“Eventually; half blind and deadly sick. By
the way, you’ve not told me why you made up
your mind to burn that letter at this precise
time?”</p>

<p>“To draw you, of course. And now you’ll be
pleased to go and see that my room’s ready;
I can hear Bernard Fane hammering at the
door, so you can play billiards with him while
I go to bye-low.”</p>

<span class="fs80">COURAGE QUAND MÊME</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">January came with the snow-drop, February
brought the crocus, and March violets
were empurpling the woods before the
next scene came on the stage and introduced
a new actor. In the meanwhile, Lucian continued
to live on Noel Farquhar’s bounty. It
should have been an intolerable position, but
Lucian’s luckless head had received such severe
bludgeonings at the hands of Fate that he
was glad to hide it anywhere, and give his pride
the congé. His choice lay between remaining
with Farquhar, retiring to the workhouse, and
expiring in a haystack without benefit of clergy;
he chose the least heroic course, and, sad to say,
he found it very pleasant.</p>

<p>One night alarm he gave Farquhar. Punctual
to its time, the cold snap of mid-January
arrived on the eleventh of the month, and Lucian
went skating at Fanes. His tutelary divinity
Dolly being absent, he was beguiled into
staying late, got chilled, and awoke Farquhar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
at three in the morning by one of his usual attacks.
It was very slight and soon checked,
but the incident strengthened the bond between
them; for Lucian did not forget Farquhar’s
face when he found him fighting for
breath, nor the lavish tenderness of his subsequent
nursing, which seemed to be extorted
from him by a force stronger than his would-be
carelessness. That constraining force Lucian
declined to christen: friendship seemed too
mild a term for Farquhar’s crude emotions.</p>

<p>No one could have felt more horribly ashamed
than Lucian, on finding that his host gave
up all engagements to wait upon him. He
was soon about again, but he now guarded his
health as though he had it on a repairing lease.
When Dolly consulted him on points of etiquette,
as she soon learned to do, he retaliated
with questions concerning the proper conduct
of an invalid; it is only fair to say that Dolly
was the more correct informant. He was welcome
at Fanes. Dolly liked him; so also did
Bernard, whose affections were pure in quality,
but exclusive; and fate gave him a third admirer
in the person of Eumenes Fane, though the
esteem in this case was but a bruised reed, liable
to fail in time of stress. Farquhar, who was
also a frequent visitor at Fanes, was not so
popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>On a fine morning in March, when the air
felt like velvet and the linnets were beginning
to nest, Bernard drove over to Swanborough
market, as his habit was, to buy Dolly her
week’s stores. On his way home he met with
an adventure. The distance from Swanborough
to Monkswell by the London road was only
fourteen miles; but Bernard’s horse was young
and fresh, and he chose a longer route through
by-ways where there was less chance of meeting
motors and traction-engines, Vronsky’s special
bugbears. Lonely, wild, and hilly was the
country-side; the gold sun had just sunk behind
the leafless woods, and a rosy twilight was
invading the sky, when Bernard turned into a
certain steep and narrow lane between high
banks of violet-haunted grass, locally known as
Hungrygut Bottom. As they spun down the
slope, from behind them sounded the nasal
Hoot! toot! which Vronsky hated. Bernard
looked back over his shoulder. A small car
with a single rider had topped the crest of the
hill and was swiftly descending: too swiftly to
be stopped at such short notice. Vronsky
could be brought to tolerate a motor that he
met; but to be overtaken and passed by one
was more than his nerves could bear. Good
whip though Bernard was, in this narrow lane he
feared disaster. Midway down, where the banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
were lower, a gate stood open, leading into a
meadow. Bernard touched up the horse, and
made for this haven as fast as he could. But,
as the dog-cart turned to enter, Vronsky caught
sight of the appalling monster behind. He
kicked, he danced, he stood on his hind-legs,
he backed the dog-cart right across the road,
and there he stayed, broadside on to the advancing
motor, while Bernard set his teeth and
awaited the crash. The car was almost upon
them: suddenly it swerved violently to the
left and flew up the bank. Right up to the top
it ran, and upset. For a moment Bernard’s
heart was in his mouth as he thought to see it
fall over sideways on the driver and burst into
flames; but it rocked, and steadied, and stood
in equilibrium, while the electric batteries came
hurtling through the air into the road like so
many fourteen-pound jampots.</p>

<p>Vronsky turned and bolted down the hill,
and was some way up the opposite slope before
Bernard could bring him to his senses.
He came back as fast as he could, and found
the driver sitting up beside his car, hatless,
with a somewhat bewildered air. He had been
pitched heels over head among the brambles
close to a heap of flints, and there he had
stayed.</p>

<p>“I say, are you hurt?” Bernard hailed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I believe I still possess
a head.”</p>

<p>The voice was soft and low and lazy, with
a touch of quaint humor. He looked up at
Bernard without offering to rise. In the twilight
Bernard could see only that he was tall
and slight and young, and dressed in gray.</p>

<p>“It was an awfully plucky thing to do. If
you’d come on I must have been killed,” said
Bernard, simply.</p>

<p>“Well, so must I, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, you’d have been pitched out, and might
have got off scot-free. It was about the pluckiest
thing I’ve seen.”</p>

<p>“The whole thing was my fault.”</p>

<p>“It was the horse’s fault, not yours at all.”</p>

<p>“It was mine,” said the stranger, with swift
decision. “I was going too fast. I should
have changed the speed to come down the hill,
and I would not; I thought I should meet no
one, and I chose to risk it. I shall have to give
up motoring, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What on earth should you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Because otherwise I shall infallibly end by
killing somebody.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t if you only take reasonable
care.”</p>

<p>“And that is precisely what I never shall do.
There’s a fascination about it—a sense of power—it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
as fatal as gambling. Yes; I must
give it up.”</p>

<p>He got on his feet with an effort and regarded
himself. Disgust at the mud on his clothes
and his hands apparently preoccupied his mind,
though he had scratched his face and bumped
his head and bruised himself most thoroughly
all down his side; in addition, Bernard saw that
his right hand was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: streaming with blood" id="tn-2">streaming with blood.</ins> This
he had not noticed until Bernard pointed it
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was the flints,” he observed, in
his former quaint and lazy way.</p>

<p>“Lucky for you you didn’t fall right on
them. Your wrist’s cut to the bone.”</p>

<p>“So I should fancy,” said the stranger,
wincing under Bernard’s ministrations. He
looked so faint with pain and loss of blood
that Bernard went down to the dog-cart and
brought up the flask which he carried in case
of accidents; with Vronsky in the shafts they
were to be expected. But when he got back
the stranger was at the top of the bank examining
his car, and rejected the brandy with thanks
and scorn.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t suffered much,” he said, with
satisfaction. “There’s a small crack in the
panel, but if I can get the batteries in I believe
I shall be able to go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t steer the thing with that wrist.
You’d better come on with me to Dove Green;
it’s only a mile on, and you can send back for
the car.”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t need two hands to steer.”</p>

<p>“But you said you meant to give up motoring.”</p>

<p>“So I do; which is an additional reason why
I should drive it to-night, when I have the
excuse.”</p>

<p>“Do you <em>like</em> the thing?” exclaimed Bernard.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like that handsome chestnut
of yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s different. A horse has
sense; you can’t compare it to that beastly,
snorting, smelling thing.”</p>

<p>“If you’d ever driven a motor, you’d be
ready to declare that it had sense, too; machinery’s
almost human, sometimes.”</p>

<p>Bernard was wholly unconvinced, and thought
the stranger a little mad. “You’d much better
come on with me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thanks very much; but I have to get on
to Monkswell this evening, and then back to
Swanborough. I came this cross-country route
because I thought I should have it to myself
and could drive fast.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to Monkswell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>“I am; do you know it?”</p>

<p>“I live there.”</p>

<p>“Do you? Then I expect you know my
friends, the Mertons, at the Hall.”</p>

<p>“M’yes.”</p>

<p>“Ah! very likely we shall meet, then; I believe
I am to stay there as soon as I get my
next leave.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose we shall,” Bernard
answered. “We hardly know them; only on
sufferance. They’re a cut above us.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>The tone was neutral, it was too dark to
read faces, and the stranger said no more. In
a minute he was calling upon Bernard to help
him set the motor on its wheels again, and together
they dragged it down into the road,
Bernard doing most of the work, for the stranger’s
strength was frail, like his physique.</p>

<p>“You’re not fit to go on,” were Bernard’s
last words, as the stranger settled uneasily into
his seat, with a tender consideration for all his
bruises and cuts. But he got no answer save
a smile and a wave of the hand. He waited
till the car was out of sight, and then fetched
Vronsky out of the field and drove home without
further incident.</p>

<p>He found Dolly waiting in the warm, dark
parlor, reading by firelight, her feet on the marble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
rim of the hearth, her face close to the
flames, which glowed and reddened the ceiling
and flickered in gold on her hair. She raised
a flushed face from her book: an intent reader
was Dolly.</p>

<p>“Where have you been? You’re late.”</p>

<p>Bernard told his story in detail.</p>

<p>“I wonder who he can be?” Dolly said,
nursing her chin in her hand.</p>

<p>“He was an awfully plucky chap, whoever
he was. I never saw anything neater than the
way he turned that machine up the bank; he
kept so jolly cool. And he made his head spin,
too, I’d bet; he’d got a lump on his forehead
the size of a seed-potato, but he never said a
word about it. Yes, he was plucky. I like
that sort.”</p>

<p>“Was he a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Rather! A regular dude to look at; all his
things were made in town, I guess.”</p>

<p>“And coming to stay with the Mertons. I
do wonder who he is?”</p>

<p>“Nobody we shall ever know, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that,” said Dolly, wisely.
“I shall ask Mr. de Saumarez.”</p>

<p>Next morning Lucian came tapping at one
of the less honourable doors of Fanes, and
was bidden enter by a preoccupied voice. He
found Dolly hard at work, with sleeves rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to the shoulders; she was in the second dairy,
but her occupation had no fellowship with
butter, cream, or cheese. A cool, dark, and
lofty chamber it was, the walls midway to
the roof being covered with white glazed tiles,
the floor with red. Waist-high stood out
a broad white shelf, now piled with square
frames of unpainted deal confining square
panes of glass, upon one of which Dolly was
spreading soft white pomade with a palette-knife.
A bushel-basket half filled with violets
stood beside her; the air reeked with the scent
of them. Lucian’s curiosity found vent in the
natural inquiry:</p>

<p>“What on earth are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” Dolly glanced round,
straightened her shoulders, swept her basket
to the floor, and exposed a three-legged milking-stool.
“There’s a chair for you; you must
not stand. I’m making scent.”</p>

<p>“How enthralling! Mayn’t I help?”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see how I do it,” quoth prudent
Dolly.</p>

<p>Lucian unwound a yard and a half of comforter,
deposited his mackintosh, umbrella, and
goloshes, and sat down to watch, tucking his
long legs under the stool, and tossing back his
shaggy brown hair. Dolly spread the white
paste thickly and evenly over the glass in two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of the frames. Next she filled her hands with
violets, decapitated the pretty blossoms, and
sprinkled them broadcast on the pomade till
the frame was full to the brim; she capped that
frame with the second and pressed them close,
so that they formed a box three inches deep,
enclosing the violets between two layers of pomade;
they were then ready to be put aside for
the time being. She would not trust Lucian to
spread the pomade, but she allowed him to behead
the violets for her, and was grateful; for
the quicker she was the fresher were the violets,
and the more valuable the pomade made
from them. Thrifty Dolly made a small income
by her perfumes.</p>

<p>Her dress, between lavender and blue, just
matched the blue chicory which borders August
cornfields; and the cluster of violets which
she had tucked into her bosom agreed with its
color. She was bareheaded, and her hair glistened
even in shadow like copper veined with
gold. She was not thinking of herself, but of
her violets, and Lucian’s eyes were fixed on
her to the hindrance of his work.</p>

<p>“You’re leaving stalks on the flowers,” Dolly
pointed out.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it. My eyes were all for
you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Dolly, brusquely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>“It’s really the correct thing to say; besides,
it’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, from you. How is your
cough?”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I pay you compliments because I
have a cough?”</p>

<p>“You may not; they don’t sound appropriate.”</p>

<p>“That’s very cruel of you. I think I shall
go home.”</p>

<p>“No; wait till you’re rested. Do you know
if the Mertons have a young man coming to
stay with them soon?”</p>

<p>“A young man, lydy? What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He nearly killed Bernard
and Vronsky with his motor-car, and Bernard
was immensely taken with him. He is young,
in the army, stationed at Swanborough, a friend
of the Mertons, and Bernard generally calls
him the dude.”</p>

<p>Dolly’s curiosity was not to be satisfied yet.
Lucian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t say, my dear girl. There are any
number of young officers at Swanborough, all
as like as peas, and you can’t call it a distinction
to run down Vronsky. If he <em>hadn’t</em> done it,
now—”</p>

<p>“I thought you might have known from the
Mertons; you know Mrs. Merton, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>“I used to, before she was married; I haven’t
kept up with all her distinguished acquaintances
since. Ah! There were days when she loved
me dearly. Once when I was a sandwich-man
she walked up and down Fleet Street with me
for an hour. I was carrying the advertisements
of ‘Woman—the Charmer,’ and I could
hear everybody saying it was an object-lesson.”</p>

<p>Dolly had by this time heard a good many
well-found anecdotes from Lucian, and had
learned that his personal experiences were
sometimes culled from another person’s past.
“I don’t believe that,” she said, calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, she gave me a penny once
when I begged of her—fact!” said Lucian, unabashed.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At a fancy ball where I went got up as a
blind beggar; I was the success of the evening.
She’s a right-down good sort, is little Ella Merton.
You never told me how you got on when
she called, by the way.”</p>

<p>“I think, pretty well,” said Dolly, doubtfully.
“Fortunately, I saw the carriage driving
down, and I sent Maggie to open the door,
instead of going myself.” Maggie was a little
black-eyed maiden of fourteen, who helped
in the housework. “I had put fresh flowers
in the parlour that very morning, and I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
wearing this dress—now it is tumbled, but it
was fresh then—”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t change it?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not; should I have?”</p>

<p>“No, you did quite right, Sweet Lavender.
Well?”</p>

<p>“I went in, and we talked. She stayed for
an hour. Part of that time I was out fetching
tea; it seemed rude, but I explained to her that
Maggie was not strong enough to carry the silver
salver. I used the red-and-gold china that
you like, and there were scones and flead-cakes,
and I put out some apricots in syrup; but very
little of each, not as Bernard likes them. I
thought that must be right, because she ate
less even than you do. Was it?”</p>

<p>Lucian was laughing without disguise as he
commended her wisdom. “And what did you
talk about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know,” said Dolly, doubtful
again. “She really does say such strange
things. Bernard will have it that she’s crazy,
but I think she’s only clever. I should imagine
her conversation was all epigrams and
paradoxes.”</p>

<p>“And what do you know about epigrams
and paradoxes, pray?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes in reviewing society novels the
newspapers give examples of the wit with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
they literally coruscate. I can’t always follow
them,” said Dolly, who was candour itself, even
to her own hindrance, “but I suppose that is
because I don’t understand the allusions. Mrs.
Merton talks like them. Why do you laugh?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Merton makes a point of talking sheer
nonsense,” said Lucian, as soon as he could
speak. “I sha’n’t send my novels to you for
criticism. Something lingering, with boiling
oil, is your idea of a mild review.”</p>

<p>“If I thought them silly I should say so,”
said Dolly, calmly; “that is, if you wanted my
opinion. But what ought I to do about Mrs.
Merton’s call? I am sure there is something,
if I only knew what?”</p>

<p>Lucian promptly furnished her with information
concerning the social laws in good society.
In all innocence, he gave her counsels
likely to raise the hair on Mrs. Merton’s head
if Dolly obeyed them. Many things Lucian
could teach, but not propriety.</p>

<p>“But what’s the use of this? I thought
you were going on the stage,” he said, breaking
away. “You haven’t forgotten about it, have
you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve not forgotten,” Dolly answered;
and she put up her hand, which had just met
his among the violets, perhaps to brush her
hair back, and perhaps to conceal her face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“What do you think of Mr. Farquhar?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Lucian, after one second’s hesitation.
“Well, he’s the best hand at a friendship
I ever met. But why?”</p>

<p>Dolly vouchsafed no answer to this question.
“I am glad you think so; you who know him
so well,” she said, scattering her violets so
carelessly that some of them fell to the floor.
Lucian picked them up and coughed in stooping.
“There! I have let you work too long.
Sit; you must.”</p>

<p>Lucian found himself maternally condemned
to the milking-stool. His face darkened as he
sat down; one might have thought him angry,
but the shadow passed over his face and was
gone. “My dear girl, why do you inquire
about Farquhar?” he said, quietly persistent.
“And why do you couple his name with your
future? Go on; you may as well tell me.”</p>

<p>Dolly hesitated. “There’s nothing to tell,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” said Lucian. “Lord! I never
thought of that! I am an owl.” And he fell
into a brown-study.</p>

<p>Violets were clinging to Dolly’s fingers and
her arms; one was even swinging in a tendril of
hair above her temple. As she went to put the
last frame in its place, she crossed the solitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
sun-ray which shot through the deep, narrow
window athwart the room, and was transfigured.
Her very lashes shone like threads of gold.</p>

<p>“Let me do that,” said Lucian, taking the
frame away. Dolly stood watching him, as a
woman will do when work is taken out of her
hands. The pile of frames was high by now,
and Lucian was careless; they tottered, and
threatened to fall.</p>

<p>“Take care!” exclaimed Dolly; and her hand
shot out beside Lucian’s, to steady them.
Round the curve of her bare arm twined a
vein as blue as lazuli, winding inwards at the
elbow, where a faint rose stained the clear
milky alabaster. Lucian took it in the palm
of his brown hand. “The loveliest thing I’ve
seen in my life, Dolly,” he said, softly.</p>

<p>The frames might fall, now; Dolly bent up
her arm so quickly that she almost shut in
Lucian’s nose. The frames did not fall, however;
for Lucian steadied them before he turned.
A rose of indignation burned in Dolly’s
cheek; she was drawing down her sleeve to hide
the insulted arm from view.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” said Lucian.</p>

<p>“I don’t allow liberties of that kind,” Dolly
retorted.</p>

<p>“Candidly, it wasn’t a liberty. An indiscretion,
if you will, but I meant what I said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p>“I think you had better go home.”</p>

<p>“I will, in a minute. But, look here; if you
shouldn’t take Farquhar, would there be any
chance for me?”</p>

<p>“You!” cried Dolly, her indignation changed
to wide amazement. Lucian smiled.</p>

<p>“Now go and tell me that the words don’t
sound appropriate from me,” he said, sweet-temperedly.
“I’ll be shot if I don’t agree with
you, too. They don’t. A poor, rickety, ill-digested
ostrich like me has no business in this
galley. All the same, I don’t believe in losing
anything for want of asking. So if Farquhar
by any chance doesn’t suit, remember you’ve
got another beau on your string—will you,
dear?”</p>

<p>But Dolly stood silent, fastening the links
at her wrist and beating the tiles with her foot.
Her virginal dignity had been ruffled, but she
did not care for that now.</p>

<p>“I thought we were friends!” she said.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Not if you are wanting this. How can we
be?”</p>

<p>“All right, then, I <em>don’t</em> want it. I guess I
know my answer when I’ve got it.”</p>

<p>Dolly took her eyes off the ground and fixed
them on his face, using all her powers of observation
and deduction. He stood laughing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
whimsical, insouciant, with his hands in his
pockets, and defied them. But Dolly remembered
that he had quoted her own words about
his incapacity. “<em>Compliments don’t sound appropriate
from you.</em>” If they had not stung,
they would have been forgotten. Dolly understood.</p>

<p>“I am sorry—I am sorry!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, don’t distress yourself. I’ve
had at least twenty affairs before, to say nothing
of being actually married.”</p>

<p>“Married!”</p>

<p>“All right, all right; I’ve no Italian wives up
my sleeve. She’s been dead these nine years
past. I merely wish to point out to you that
my heartstrings take cement. Look here, I’m
going to call you Dolly; do you mind?”</p>

<p>“Is it the proper thing?” began Dolly, her
eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear girl; say we’re cousins—we
are, through Adam. Anyway, I’ll do the lying
for you; I’m handy at it. Are you going to
have old Farquhar?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t care for him?”</p>

<p>Dolly shook her head.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity. But he’s very keen on
you?”</p>

<p>“How can I possibly tell? He’s not said so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be coy; now don’t,” said Lucian.
“I’m anxious to further your happiness. Then,
I take it, he’s desperately smitten; h’m! he’ll
be neither to hold nor to bind, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“I am sure this conversation is not at all
the proper thing,” said Dolly, demurely.</p>

<p>“It’s not, like the holes in my elbows; you’re
right there. But look here; what I want to
say is this: There’s a heap of unregenerate
wickedness in old Farquhar, as I reckon you’ve
found out, but anybody he likes can lead him
by the nose. I’ve heard him talk surprising
bosh about his career, and the aims of his life,
und so wieder; but I tell you he’d throw the
whole cargo overboard to the sharks if it got in
your way. You know what his arm’s like?
Well, he’s got a mind made on the same pattern;
and you, my dear, good girl, have got Samson
in chains. And mind you don’t play Delilah,
or there’ll be the etcetera to pay. That’s the
truth for you.”</p>

<p>Dolly listened to this homily and did not
commit herself. “I believe you really want
me to marry him,” was her comment.</p>

<p>“I’d dance at the wedding with a light
heart,” Lucian averred.</p>

<p>“That you should not; nothing could be
worse for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>“Look here, I’ve had one mother,” said
Lucian. “Be a sister for a change, now
do.”</p>

<p>“I like looking after you.”</p>

<p>“So does Farquhar. Community of tastes—”</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. de Saumarez, will you go home?
I’ve the dinner to lay.”</p>

<p>“Lunch, we call it in society.”</p>

<p>“I shall give you a dose of cod-liver oil if you
don’t go.”</p>

<p>The threat was sufficient, and Lucian fled,
forgetting his comforter and goloshes. Dolly
swept the floor and washed the shelf and put
all trim again. “I wish I loved him,” once
she said, and offered to her coldness the tribute
of a sigh.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The rejected suitor did not at once return
to The Lilacs. He made a détour through the
church-yard, and sat down to meditate appropriately
among the tombs. Lucian could not,
like his friend, claim the consolations of religion,
for he was an agnostic. That is to say, he acknowledged
that he did not know anything;
he did not boast that he knew nothing. Like
poor James Thomson, he thought, as he saw
the spire ascending to the blue and open sky,
that it would be sweet to enter in, to kneel and
pray; the pride of unbelief was not his sin. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
was a pity that he could not do it, because he
had a natural gift for religion; and no one pretends
that agnosticism, except that militant on
a stump in Hyde Park, is a soul-satisfying
creed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br><br>
<span class="fs80">“I HAVE THEE BY THE HANDS<br>
AND WILL NOT LET THEE GO”</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">That afternoon Dolly tied a handkerchief
over her head and with Maggie’s help
spring-cleaned the parlour, an operation which
involved the brushing, clapping, and dusting
of every separate volume on the shelves. She
moved the furniture out into the hall, swept
the floor with tea-leaves mixed with violets,
and had everything tidy in time for tea at
half-past five. A capable housewife was
Dolly Fane. But after tea she left Maggie
to wash up, under orders to be careful of
the Worcester china which Lucian admired,
and herself went out for a walk to rest herself.</p>

<p>Beyond the stream a hill rose steep and
grassy, crossed by the hedge-rows and sentinel
elms of a Kentish lane, still netted in
autumn’s grey clematis, though violets blossomed
thick below. Eglantine Lane was its
local name; it was a lonely place, neglected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the parish council, and voluminously muddy.
A satirical notice-board announced that the authorities
would not be responsible for injuries
sustained by persons using the unmetalled part
of the road, and another sign at the top of the
hill described it truthfully as Dangerous to
Cyclists. Dolly, nevertheless, scaled it without
loss of breath; she had been on her feet
since six in the morning, but she knew no better
how to feel tired than the unfortunate Hans
how to shiver and shake. Near the top was a
gate and a stile, and a view of a field which had
broken out into a black small-pox of heaps that
were presently to be strewn over the soil. Fish-manure:
as Dolly had known a month ago at
Fanes, any day when the wind was blowing
from the east. These are the vernal scents of
happy Kent.</p>

<p>Dolly climbed upon the post of the stile to
look at the crops and congratulate herself that
Bernard was a better farmer than his neighbours.
Bernard worked with his men, and was
to be seen in due season carting manure with
the best of them; though, afterwards, Dolly
forbade him the parlour and grudged him the
house until he had bathed and changed. Example
is better than precept, and Fane’s farm
flourished while others declined; and Dolly, to
whom Bernard was still the first man in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
world, glowed with sympathetic triumph in
watching his fruitful acres.</p>

<p>She presently witnessed a touching scene.
At a stone’s-throw beyond the next bend stood
a solitary cottage, and from the cottage came
wandering a stray angel aged three, with blue
eyes and golden curls and a brow of smutty
pearl. The angel progressed erratically, chanting
a ditty, and smiting the ground with a stick
as tall as herself. So large a sceptre is awkward
for handling, and it soon happened that
it got between the angel’s fat legs and upset
her in the mire. The ditty became an ululation.
Dolly was trying to screw her recalcitrant
sympathy up to the point of sympathizing
when a fresh actor appeared. Round the corner
spun a cyclist at full speed, who came within a
hair of involving the angel and himself in one
red ruin. A skilful rider, he skirted the edge of
tragedy and passed safely by, but immediately
jumped off his bicycle and went back to see
what was wrong. He heard a perfectly unintelligible
tale of woe, ruined his handkerchief
by using it as a towel, consoled the angel with
a penny, and sent her off with a kiss.</p>

<p>The last was too much for Dolly; she laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s you,” said Farquhar. He wheeled
his bicycle to the bank and came and leaned
against the gate. Something in his tone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
his words, some threat in his manner (always
the truthful index of his mood), prompted Dolly
to say, in her chilliest tones:</p>

<p>“Are you going to stay?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go.”</p>

<p>She put one hand on the post to vault down.
Farquhar took her wrists and forcibly stayed
her. “No, you won’t; I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Talk, then; I won’t answer you.”</p>

<p>“Will you answer if I let you go?”</p>

<p>Dolly thought for a minute and slowly answered,
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Farquhar, releasing her.
“I’ve been wanting to speak to you this month
past. Why have you kept out of my way?”</p>

<p>“For the same reason that I’m speaking to
you now: because I chose to.”</p>

<p>“Because you chose to—Dolly, I swear I
never saw a woman to compare with you for
beauty! Why don’t you ride? On horseback
you’d be a queen.”</p>

<p>“I used to, but my horse got staked and had
to be shot.”</p>

<p>“Were you on him?”</p>

<p>“I was; afterwards he was on me.”</p>

<p>“My God! I’m glad I didn’t see it.”</p>

<p>“I was not hurt; and why should it affect
you if I had been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>“Anything affects me that has to do with
you. I’m in love with you; you know it.”</p>

<p>“How much?” inquired Dolly. He stood;
she still sat on the gate, one foot swinging, and
his face, thrown back to look up at her, fronted
the sunset. Dolly felt like Fatima turning
the little golden key, but she was at present
mistress of the situation, and her spirits rose.
“How much?” she said again.</p>

<p>“You want the whole fool’s catalogue?
Hear, then: you’re heaven and earth and hell,
sun and darkness, flower and dove and angel,
light of my soul, fire in my veins—no! I’ll be
hanged if those trashy similes will serve! I’ll
tell you what you’re like: quick-lime in the eyes,
vitriol on the naked flesh. See there!”—he
pushed his sleeve up (Dolly, though her nerves
were tolerably steady, uttered an exclamation)—“see
those scars? I’ll tell you what they are—ants.
I’ve been tied up to be eaten alive by
them. You put it to yourself what that’s like.
Well, I’d stand that all over again sooner than
have you refuse me.”</p>

<p>That he was sincere and spoke the truth Dolly
could not doubt, and he made her sick; she
turned away her face. Farquhar dropped from
passion to passionate entreaty, his voice sank
to a murmur, he captured her hand and pressed
it to his cold cheek. “Dolly, Dolly, give yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to me, and I’ll make you love me; I swear
it. You’re my only one, my own; I’d not snap
my fingers to win a queen. I’ve never so much
as kissed a woman before. You’ll never have
a man say that to you again and tell the truth.
And I’ll never change; don’t you make any
error about that. What I say to-day I’ll
say again in fifty years, when you’re old and
ugly. Only come to me, Dolly; do come to me.
Dolly, Dolly!” He was covering her palm
with kisses; his lips were hot, though he was
shivering, or rather shuddering. “If you’ll
only come, I’ll make you love me,” he said,
lifting his face; and the surprising strength of
his passion made Dolly own that the boast was
likely to prove true. She was moved. Bluebeard’s
chamber was worth exploring; but she
did not want to stay there.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t love you, Mr. Farquhar,” she
said, calmly. “I hate the way you talk, and I
mean to be my own mistress awhile yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say no word that could hurt a child.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of that? Your thoughts
are all wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my thoughts in as I keep my
tongue.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dolly, with mounting spirit.</p>

<p>Farquhar bent his head against her knee and
breathed hard. When he looked up he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
haggard. He was suffering there before her
eyes, but hardily.</p>

<p>“I’ll not take that answer as final,” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s not meant to be. I want time to
think.”</p>

<p>“Do you? I’ll have you yet.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure. I’d far rather marry Mr.
de Saumarez.”</p>

<p>“Has that miserable little etiolated pensioner
of mine dared to come after you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of my friend so, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to go and beg his pardon?
I’d do it, if you told me.”</p>

<p>Only the thought of Lucian’s disgust kept
Dolly back from taking him at his word. “I
like Mr. de Saumarez, and I don’t think I like
you at all. But you can give me the position
I want, and he can’t. I want time to think it
over. Come to me three months hence, and
I’ll tell you my decision.”</p>

<p>“Do you like love at second-hand? De
Saumarez has carried his sweetheart’s letter
against his heart for nine years, and she wasn’t
you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like his love at tenth-hand better than
yours,” said Dolly, with spirit.</p>

<p>Farquhar laughed grimly. “And there you’re
wrong, my dear. I love you pretty decently
well, though I’ll admit there’s a bit of the devil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
in me. You want me to wait three months?
All right; only I warn you that my position
and, consequently, your ambition’ll suffer.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Do you expect me to reel out platitudes in
Parliament while you’re playing the deuce with
me? Not much! And if I hold my tongue
this session, I may as well take the Chiltern
Hundreds.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Dolly, a trifle cross. “You
could do it if you tried. Of course, if you lose
your position you won’t be so eligible.”</p>

<p>“Hard lines; you put me on the rack and
punish me for being disabled. But I’ll have
you yet, in spite of yourself.”</p>

<p>“You may,” retorted Dolly, “or, on the other
hand, you mayn’t.”</p>

<p>“I shall.”</p>

<p>“Peut-être. Please to move, Mr. Farquhar,
I want to get down.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. A kiss first, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“I will not! Take your arm away.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Farquhar, evenly. “I’m going
to have one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never give it you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it, then.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this is the way to make me
have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>“I do; a woman’s never mistress of herself
till she’s been mastered by a man.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apply your aphorisms to me, if you
please; I’m not like the women you know.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you? That’s where you make a mistake,
my girl; women never know themselves.”</p>

<p>“I know myself well enough to be sure I’m
not going to kiss you.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly you aren’t; that’s not the
point, though I should like you to. I’m going
to kiss you.”</p>

<p>“Let me go!”</p>

<p>“One kiss, Dolly.”</p>

<p>“Let me go!” Dolly repeated, struggling
against him. She would have had a chance
with any other man, for she was strong and
supple and desperate; but Noel Farquhar’s
arms closed round her like a snake’s constricting
folds. Though the cottage was within earshot,
Dolly would have died sooner than call
for help. She went on fighting, and when he
drew her down she turned her face away. Uselessly:
Farquhar’s hand was laid against her
cheek, and he bent her face to his. They looked
into each other’s eyes: Dolly’s all rebellion,
his all fire; and then he kissed her.</p>

<p>Once only; he had sufficient self-control to
let her go when he had kept his word. Dolly
pulled out her handkerchief to brush it away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
If she had had a knife she would have used it
against him; yet behind her anger there was
an unwilling respect. That immense strength
which she could not defy, the strength of will
as well as the strength of body, had left its
impression. Farquhar was right in thinking
that he had stamped his claims upon her
memory. It was better that she should say,
as she did, “I hate you from the bottom of my
heart,” than that she should part from him in
a mood of calm and confident triumph.</p>

<p>“Well, I love you,” he answered her, simply.
“There; I beg your pardon. You’ll not forgive
me, of course, but—well, there are times when
I wonder if I’m mad.”</p>

<p>“You’ve made that excuse before; try something
fresh.”</p>

<p>“Did I? It’s the truth. Dolly, you—” He
put up his hand over his eyes. “Sheer madness;
or say I’m drunk. Dolly, what—what eyes
you’ve got!”</p>

<p>That was the last she heard from him that
night. They parted, he taking a footpath to
The Lilacs. He forgot his bicycle, and Dolly,
seeing it, wheeled it down to Fanes to the safe
custody of the tool-shed, not without some pride
in an affection which could make a man oblivious
of a very handsome, free-wheeled, Bowden-braked,
acetylene-lamped, silver-plated, thirty-guinea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Singer. At that hour Lucian’s chances
were poor.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” was Bernard’s
greeting when she came into the parlour.
“Merton’s been here, and left a note for you.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him in those slippers?” exclaimed
Dolly, pointing at the purple cross-stitched
pansies which spread their blossoms
over Bernard’s instep. Bernard looked at them
himself.</p>

<p>“They’re all right; they haven’t got any
holes,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m sure gentlemen don’t wear such things.
In the evening they wear—they wear pumps.”</p>

<p>“They may wear pumps or they may wear
buckets,” Bernard responded. “I guess I don’t
much care. Old Merton wears slippers, for
I’ve seen ’em on him. You open the letter
and see what Mrs. Merton says—if she writes
so that you can understand her, that is.”</p>

<p>Dolly perused the note, written in a random,
spidery fashion upon hand-made paper. “She
wants us to dine there on Thursday,” she said,
tapping her lips with the paper in a thoughtful
manner.</p>

<p>“Thursday? I shall be at Swanborough
market.”</p>

<p>“Dinner means eight o’clock in the evening;
you’ll be home then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot,” said Bernard. “Shall you
accept?”</p>

<p>Dolly did not reply, but continued to tap her
lips. Mrs. Merton had been at the pains of
mentioning her other invited guests. Presently
Dolly said, “Bernard.”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had two offers of marriage to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad Farquhar’s come up to the scratch.
I didn’t want to have to thrash him. But who’s
the other?”</p>

<p>“Lucian de Saumarez.”</p>

<p>“Him!” exclaimed Bernard. “Dolly, I’d
take him; I like him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know, I know; so do I. But he hasn’t
a penny.”</p>

<p>“He’d take you about and show you things.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; out of a third-class window. I
don’t care for that.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to have that Farquhar
chap?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not quite made up my mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll be a fool if you choose him,”
said Bernard, returning to the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>;
and human nature is so constituted that at that
moment Dolly would have accepted Farquhar
on the spot, had he been present.</p>

<p>The clock struck nine. Dolly got up, extended
her arms above her head, and yawned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“Oh, I <em>am</em> sleepy,” she said. “Good-night,
Bernard.”</p>

<p>“’D-night,” answered Bernard, deep in the
finance news.</p>

<p>Dolly moved towards the door; then, a certain
thought crossing her mind, she came to
Bernard’s chair and bent her beautiful head.</p>

<p>“Give me a kiss, Bernie.”</p>

<p>Somewhat surprised, Bernard complied.</p>

<p>“Do you like kissing me, Bernard?”</p>

<p>“M’yes. I don’t mind it. Why?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Dolly, and lighted her candle for
bed.</p>

<span class="fs80">WE TOOK SWEET COUNSEL TOGETHER</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Lucian was a poor sleeper, hard to lull and
easy to rouse, with a habit of waking at
four in the morning and reading novels in
bed; his good nights had six hours’ sleep, his
bad nights none. As a young man, he had innocently
done his best to acquire the chloral
habit, but years had taught him wisdom; his
present panacea was bromide of potassium, of
which, at times, he took a surprising quantity.
But he shunned it whenever he could.</p>

<p>Excitements in the day usually entailed sleeplessness
at night. After Dolly refused him Lucian
was not surprised to find himself broad
awake at one o’clock in the morning, with every
prospect of remaining so. But the dark hours
had long ceased to seem interminable; he lighted
the gas, enshrouded himself in a gorgeous dressing-gown,
in whose gay colours he took an
artless pleasure, and devoted his mind to the
<cite>Golden Novelettes</cite>, at a penny a number. Since
Lucian’s last illness, Farquhar slept in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
dressing-room adjoining, and usually left the
communicating door ajar; but Lucian had wisely
shut it early in the evening, and was blest
in solitude.</p>

<p>Towards dawn a voice came through that
closed door, repeating the very name which
was running in Lucian’s thoughts. “Dolly,
Dolly!” Lucian took it for the creature of his
brain, and thought with joy that now he might
legitimately take some bromide; but it came
again, and was this time coupled with epithets
which had never crossed Lucian’s mind, still
less his lips. He divined that something was
wrong with Farquhar, and slid off his bed to
see, taking a candle. Farquhar lay on his back,
restlessly muttering, between sleep and delirium;
his face was flushed and his skin dry. “Fever,”
said Lucian, and sat down to watch.</p>

<p>Fever ravings are not commonly coherent, nor
do patients, except in books, relate at length
the stories of their lives; all that Lucian learned
was some strange oaths, besides the fact that
Farquhar wanted water. He supplied that desire
liberally, and presently had the satisfaction
of seeing Farquhar wake up and stare about
him with the air of a man newly released from
Incubus.</p>

<p>“Fever, sonny?” said Lucian. “How did
you pick up that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>“In Africa. Yes, I’m let in for it occasionally—curse
the place! I’ve had a pretty bad
turn, I reckon. Where’s that clinical?”</p>

<p>The thermometer when consulted climbed to
a hundred and three, and Farquhar decreed
quinine. Hurrying off to prevent him in getting
it, Lucian caught the tail of his robe in the
fire-irons and dragged the fender half across the
room before he could stop. He turned round
and solemnly cursed it with a malediction exceeding
that of the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of
Rheims. Farquhar flung a pillow to speed him
on his way, and Lucian stepped backward into
the water-jug.</p>

<p>When this contretemps had been arranged
with the help of the towels, Lucian sat on the
bed—a quaint figure, with his bright eyes
and brown face and draggle-tailed dressing-gown,
the skirt of which he carefully spread
over a chair to keep it away from his ankles.</p>

<p>“You ought to be in bed,” said Farquhar,
impatiently; “not sitting up and playing the
fool with me. Phew! how hot it is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not asking for any flowers on my
grave,” said Lucian. “I like doing it. And,
look here, Farquhar; I don’t want to be inquisitive,
but have you been making love to Miss
what’s-her-name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>Farquhar sprang up. “What’s it to you if
I have?”</p>

<p>“Something, sonny; because I happen to
have been making love to her myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, confound you! Living here on my
charity, and by way of return you make love
to my girl on the sly.”</p>

<p>“Farquhar, you shut up and lie down,” said
Lucian, authoritatively.</p>

<p>Tormented with fever and worse tormented
with jealousy, midway between love and friendship,
Farquhar hesitated; but he finished by
obeying. He flung up his scarred hand over
his eyes and breathed deeply, longing for coolness.
“Put that light out,” he said, “it drives
me wild. I’ll be right enough to-morrow, but I’m
ill now, and that’s the fact. Ill! I’m parching!”</p>

<p>Lucian snuffed out the candle neatly between
his finger and thumb, an inelegant trick which
has the advantage of killing the smell. “You
been popping the question?” he asked, and
dropped his long cold fingers across Farquhar’s
forehead.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’m to wait three months.”</p>

<p>“What on earth for?”</p>

<p>“She wants to consider my virtues—and
yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>“Mine? Oh, I’m out of the running; I only
put myself forward as a pis-aller, in case you
didn’t suit.”</p>

<p>“You’re not out of the running. I shouldn’t
wonder if she took you. She says she likes
you better than me.”</p>

<p>“You sure of that?”</p>

<p>“She told me so to my face. I wished her
in Hades.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it badly, sonny, very badly;
but I’d rather you didn’t swear at her.”</p>

<p>“Badly? Yes. But I’ll tell you what’s
playing the mischief with me—I kissed her.”</p>

<p>“She let you?”</p>

<p>Farquhar laughed. “I took it.”</p>

<p>“Oho, my irreverent friend, you did, did you?”</p>

<p>“I did. Heavenly sweet it was, too; where
do they get it, these girls, the power to drive
a man sheer mad—hold on, will you? you
dashed fool! That’s meant for me, De Saumarez,
not you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact,” said Lucian, “that I never
could resist a kiss myself. After all, there’s
no harm in it, and it’s mighty agreeable when
both parties are willing; though I take it
Miss Dolly was not?”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t. You’re right there.”</p>

<p>“Upon my solemn honour, I wish I could
thrash you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p>A scratch and a spurt of white flame: Farquhar
had struck a lucifer. The outleap of
light showed Lucian’s unguarded face and was
gone.</p>

<p>“My God!” said Farquhar, “and it’s the
truth!”</p>

<p>Lucian got up, went into his own room, and
shut himself in. An instant later there shone
again the lighted parallelogram of the open
doorway with his figure black against it, as he
came stoically back to his place on the bed.
Farquhar said through the darkness, “I’ll be
damned if you shall get her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be damned if you shall,” Lucian answered.</p>

<p>Truth cleared the air, as it generally does.
They had been in deadly jealousy the minute
before, but now a spirit of Christian charity fell
upon them.</p>

<p>“She’s safe to choose you,” Lucian argued.
“She’s as ambitious as she can stand, and look
at me! I don’t know which is more invalid,
my health or my prospects.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t be taken for my money. You
see here: didn’t you say you could model and
carve? I’ve just bought a granite-quarry in
the Ardennes, and I’ll put you in as managing
partner, and in three months you’ll be talking
differently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>“I bet you a shilling you’ll go bankrupt if
you do!”</p>

<p>“Betting’s contrary to Christian principles.”</p>

<p>They both laughed, and then Lucian said:
“Seems to me you rather enjoy shamming virtuous,
you consummate old humbug!”</p>

<p>“I do; hadn’t you found that out?”</p>

<p>“I can believe virtue comes easier when it’s a
vice,” said Lucian, meditatively; “but it strikes
me very forcibly, sonny, that patient continuance
in well-doing has undermined your principles.
You’d feel pretty awkward at going to
the deuce.”</p>

<p>“Would I? If I had that girl in my power,
I’d be handy enough.”</p>

<p>“I deny it; but let that pass. Anyhow, if
you had me in your power you wouldn’t lift
a finger against me.”</p>

<p>“If you got between me and her—”</p>

<p>“You’d say, ‘Confound you, my children!’
and bite your thumb at us.”</p>

<p>“For my own sake and not yours, then; I
never did an unselfish thing yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a liar,” said Lucian. “Why <em>do</em>
you tell such lies? And, look here; I’ve something
serious to say to you. I won’t put up
with being told I live on your charity, not even
when you’re sick.”</p>

<p>“I shall say what I please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>“And I shall go when I please.”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound you!” said Farquhar; and he
laughed and acquiesced.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As has been said, Dolly was at this time inclining
towards Farquhar, but an episode of
the next week set the rivals even again. She
and Bernard accepted Mrs. Merton’s invitation.
She bought a book on etiquette and
studied it, but was nervous, nevertheless.
Bernard also studied the book, because he
wished to avoid blunders, but he remained perfectly
composed; a point illustrating the radical
difference between their characters. Bernard
took in to dinner a pretty, clever, well-bred,
well-dressed girl of five-and-twenty, who
had heard his story, was impressed by his looks,
and took an interest in him, as she told Mrs.
Merton. She tried to draw him out and put
him at his ease, and their conversation grew
rather humourous ere she recognized her error.</p>

<p>Dolly’s partner was a big, dark, heavy-featured
man, with a low, soft, monotonous voice
and tired eyes. Hugh Meryon was Hugh Meryon
to Dolly, and he was nothing more; but at
Monaco he was known as Gambling Meryon,
for among gamblers his play was remarkable
by reason of his extraordinary and fantastic
luck. He was the son of a highly respectable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
dean, and had suffered a highly respectable
education; but he was born to gamble as the
sparks fly upward, and gamble he did, sacrificing
all to his passion. He loved the excitement,
not the money won: like Fox, who declared
that his favourite occupation was playing and
winning, his second favourite playing and losing.
His presence at Monkswell was due to Mrs.
Merton’s fondness for black sheep, mustard
with mutton, and other things which she should
not have liked.</p>

<p>“I hear De Saumarez was to have come to-night,”
Meryon began, without preface, before
the advent of the soup. “I’m awfully sorry he
couldn’t, I wanted to see him again. Do you
know him?”</p>

<p>“Do <em>you</em> know him?” Dolly exclaimed, simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; I used to know him pretty well,
but I haven’t seen him for nine years. But
he’s the sort of fellow one doesn’t forget; besides,
I was there when his wife died.”</p>

<p>“Did you know her? What was she like?”</p>

<p>“Awfully delicate, and quite young and very
pretty. De Saumarez was mad about her,
waited on her hand and foot, though he wasn’t
much good himself. You used to see him taking
her out in a bath-chair and dodging the
stones for fear they should jolt her—I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
boring you!” Meryon was diffident, and always
expected to be found a bore; he had taken
fright now at his own fluency, and annoyed
Dolly inexpressibly by trying to talk about the
weather, which he could not do. It was several
minutes before she got him on the track
again.</p>

<p>“What was wrong with Mrs. de Saumarez?”</p>

<p>“Consumption.”</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of that himself now.”</p>

<p>“Is he? I expect he’s caught it from her—doctors
say you can, and he was always with
her. But the queerest part of it all was the
end.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Dolly, softly. Meryon had forgotten
her, and she thought it safer to let him
forget, lest he should shy again. The gambler
went on, simply:</p>

<p>“He came in to me one night looking rather
wild and asked me to play. I didn’t want to;
I didn’t want to clean him out with his wife sick,
and I knew my next streak of luck was about
due. And once I begin I can’t leave off—the
cards won’t let you go till they’ve had their
sport out. But he would have it. Écarté we
chose; I could tell every card in every game
we played, and that was fifty-three—but that
wouldn’t interest you. Anyway, I’ve seen
queer things in the cards, but never anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
so queer as that night’s play. I dare say you’ve
heard that gamblers say spades mean death.
Well, the king of spades kept on haunting us,
and every time the black suit showed I swept
the board. He kept on doubling the stakes,
and I—I lost my head, as I always do, so when
we came to the end of the spell and counted up
I found I’d won sixteen thousand of him; only
fancy! He swore that Marguerite—his wife,
you know—was provided for, but I didn’t believe
him, for he was just as if he were fey. So
then he asked me to come in and see her and
convince myself, and I said I would, then and
there, though it was three in the morning. I
was pretty queer, for the cards had got into
my head, and I was counting the steps and multiplying
them by the stones on the pavement,
and I was mad with myself besides, and I
thought I might get her to take it back, or
some of it. Well, he took me in and up; I
didn’t know where he was going till he threw
open a door, and there we were in her room,
and there was she laid out on the bed, dead.
Candles at the four corners, and flowers all
about—I never shall forget it.” He shuddered
and stopped.</p>

<p>“And Mr. de Saumarez?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was like a lunatic—talking to her—He’d
put by money for the funeral; that’s what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
he meant by saying she was provided for. He
hadn’t ten shillings himself. I tried to get him
to take some, but he went off after the funeral,
and I didn’t see him again. I never have, till
now. I swore I’d never touch a card again,
after that.”</p>

<p>“And did you keep your vow?” Dolly asked,
not because she had much curiosity upon the
subject; one is not greatly interested in the
feelings of a phonograph.</p>

<p>“Yes, till a girl I knew asked me to play—I
couldn’t refuse her.”</p>

<p>“Did she know of your promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she wanted me to play specially.
You see, I had rather a name; my luck’s so
queer. She was writing a book about it; besides,
she didn’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Oh, afterwards, I just went on playing. It
didn’t seem worth while not to, you know,”
said the gambler, with his tired smile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X<br><br>
<span class="fs80">WAS THAT THE LANDMARK?</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">As a hostess Mrs. Merton possessed a penetrating
amiability which could persuade
the lioness to lie down with the lamb, and
could temporarily repair rifts in the social lute
so well that it would run up and down the
social scale without any disconcerting discords.
When she brought up her women guests after
dinner, they gathered round the fire and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: gossipped" id="tn-3">gossiped</ins>
like school-girls. Sitting next the mantel-piece
with her shoes on the tiled hearth,
shielding her face with a peacock-feather fan,
Bernard’s pretty partner was holding forth concerning
flirtation. She had thin little features
and a retroussé nose, and she lifted and moved
her head like a bird; her thick, curly fair hair
was cut short; her eyes were gray and clear, and
not a little imperious. In dress she was so demure
and simple that Dolly set her down as a
great heiress, not discerning that her demure
simplicity was of the kind that comes from
Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>“No. I detest flirtation,” she was saying.
“It is an appeal to the vulgarity of our
natures. It may be fit for men, but not for
women.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” drawled her vis-à-vis, a plain
but well-dressed young matron with fine dark
eyes: “you never set eyes on Hugh Meryon before
to-day, and you sat in the brambles with
him the whole afternoon!”</p>

<p>“She was converting him,” said Ella Merton.
“She belongs to the Anti-Gambling League,
don’t you, Angela? and she had to gambol
around him to lure him away.”</p>

<p>“Always think that people are like consols,
they lose interest when they’re converted,”
murmured the dark-eyed matron, whom Dolly
recognized as the lady in the black frills.</p>

<p>“Maud, don’t be flippant,” said Angela, not
at all disconcerted. “If you know Mr. Meryon,
you must know that he absolutely can’t
flirt. That’s why I like him.”</p>

<p>“I like flirting,” said Maud; “it’s so desperately
interesting. Talking sense is such a
desperate bore, you know. It’s all very well
for you, my dear girl; men’ll listen to an angel
that’s paid a visit to Worth. But with my sallow
complexion it’s simply suicidal.”</p>

<p>“Men who flirt are no better than city clerks
who kiss their best girls under the mistletoe at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
suburban tea-parties,” said Angela, elevating
her little pointed chin.</p>

<p>“Now, I like that kind of young man,” said
Ella: “besides, they don’t exist. She won’t
talk like this when she’s married, will she,
Maud?”</p>

<p>“I never shall marry,” Angela asseverated.
“To decline a proposal is bad enough, but to
accept one—horrible!”</p>

<p>“Don’t see where the horrors come in,” murmured
Maud, placidly. “I suppose my sensibilities
aren’t fine enough. I’ve always enjoyed
it.”</p>

<p>“I dislike the ceremony of kissing,” said Angela,
throwing down the gauntlet.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a ceremony, it’s one of the rites of
women,” said Ella, dissolving into laughter.</p>

<p>Angela laughed too. She was in earnest, but
not to the extent of becoming a bore. “I believe
in the rights of women,” she said. “Don’t
you agree with me, Miss Fane?”</p>

<p>“About kissing?” said Dolly, “I don’t think
it matters much; a kiss means nothing.”</p>

<p>Angela looked rather horrified; Maud Prideaux
smiled behind her fan; Mrs. Merton was
frankly interested. “What a lovely original
idea!” she said. “All the three-volume novels
used to end with the first kiss. Lord Arthur
saw sanctified snakes, and Lady Imogen felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the tide of love bearing her away and her hair
came down. And in girls’ stories it’s the bell
that rings down the curtain on the sacred scene.
And you don’t believe in it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dolly, speaking in her swift,
straightforward way. “A kiss is a touch and
nothing more, neither pleasant nor the reverse.
What I should dislike would be to be kissed
against my will.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite a revolutionary, Miss Fane,”
drawled Mrs. Prideaux. “I sha’n’t let my husband
talk to you.”</p>

<p>“With your sallow complexion it would
be simply suicidal,” Mrs. Merton agreed,
smoothly.</p>

<p>Maud Prideaux’s cynicism was pointed by
the fact that she and her husband were notoriously
devoted.</p>

<p>“I’d trust Lal anywhere,” said Angela Laurenson,
half to herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lal! but we all know that Lal’s perfection.
When’s he coming, Angela? I wonder
you exist without him,” said Mrs. Prideaux.
Angela coloured, but she stood her
ground.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, I expect,” she said. “I hoped
he would be here to-night, but he said he might
not be able to get off.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall have to be on our best behaviour—”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Mrs. Prideaux was beginning, when
the gentlemen, coming up, cut short the discussion.</p>

<p>In the solitude of her chamber, Dolly that
night took her heart and mind to pieces, and
diligently perquisited all their workings, pried
into motives, dissected sensations, and probed
like any surgeon. She wanted replies to two
questions: first, why she was unnaturally indifferent
to kisses; second, whether she preferred
Lucian de Saumarez or Noel Farquhar.
Her analysis left her little the wiser; she got
few facts, because there were few to get. As
Bernard would have accepted a kiss with unaffected
composure, so Dolly in the same spirit
could not understand the pother made about
the matter; she was gifted with a masculine
indifference, or, as Angela Laurenson would have
phrased it, with no feminine modesty. Yet,
when she turned to the second question, the
thought of loving either suitor sent Dolly flying
to unapproachable snow-peaks of virgin
coldness, where the foot of no man ever had
trodden or ever would tread. Dolly married,
loving and beloved, the mother of half a dozen
children, would still have kept in her heart a
shrine of vestal purity. Careless about the
borders of her kingdom she might be, but the
citadel was inviolable. She came out of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
quest little the wiser, but with her mind made
up.</p>

<p>She turned on her pillow and slept soundly,
till the dawn, blossoming like a golden rose between
the clouds, shone in upon her lying between
linen sheets which smelt of violets, with
all her chestnut hair twisted into one thick
plait. The light roused her, and she was up in
a trice and splashing in her tub of rain-water;
then dressing rapidly, rolling up her hair in a
knot, fastening on her blue dress and her plain
white apron: in twenty minutes she was ready.
Down-stairs she went full ten minutes late, and
annoyed with herself and consequently with
Maggie, who had been late too—for no reason,
as Dolly told her, severely. Dolly laid the table
for breakfast, with a pot of wall-flowers in the
middle; she fetched the coffee-pot, and put on
the milk to boil in an enamelled saucepan, and
refilled the shining kettle—all Dolly’s pots and
pans looked like silver. She sliced the bacon
into the thinnest of thin rashers and set Maggie
to fry it. Finally she went to the churn, where
she should have been half an hour earlier, praying
that the butter might come quickly. She
stood at the open window; the sun looked
across the sill; a brown bee hummed in, seeking
the wall-flowers; the bacon sizzled, the
churn gurgled, and Dolly frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p>“Oo, miss,” said Maggie, pausing with the
frying-pan aslant—“Oo, miss, there’s a gentleman
coming down the drive!”</p>

<p>“Hold the frying-pan straight!” was Dolly’s
stern reply.</p>

<p>“Oo, miss,” said the irrepressible one, staring,
wide-eyed, “but he’s coming to the window,
and it’s—”</p>

<p>“Go on with your work!” said Dolly, in such
a tone that Maggie went on. A shadow fell
across Dolly’s hands.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Sister Dolly,” said Lucian
de Saumarez, leaning his elbows on the sill.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me that; I’m not a Roman Catholic,”
said Dolly, not too graciously.</p>

<p>“Nor I, praise the pigs!”</p>

<p>“Why, do you dislike them so?”</p>

<p>“I hate the doctrine of confession and the
system of spiritual directors,” said Lucian, with
unusual emphasis. “I call it morally degrading—however,
I didn’t come here to talk theology.
Is the agrarian barbarian anywhere about?”</p>

<p>“Bernard’ll be in to breakfast at half-past
seven, if you mean him.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I’ll wait. Hullo, Maggie;
how’s the headache?”</p>

<p>“Teethache, sir,” said the delighted Maggie,
dropping a courtesy. “They’re nicely, thank
you, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>“Maggie, go and dust the parlour; I’ll see to
the bacon,” said Dolly. Maggie retired quite
crestfallen and sad.</p>

<p>“Why did you send the child off? She wasn’t
doing any harm,” said Lucian.</p>

<p>“I’ll call her back and go myself, if you want
to talk to her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, I don’t; you know I don’t. But
why are you so cross?”</p>

<p>“Because I was late,” said Dolly, candidly,
and laughed, and recovered her temper. “Why
weren’t you at the Mertons’ last night? Mrs.
Merton said she asked you.”</p>

<p>“I was looking after old Farquhar; he’s been
seedy.” Dolly’s lip curled. “Fact, I assure
you. He had a touch of fever the night before
last, and raved about you like Old Boots.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought that as a literary
man you might find a better simile. I met a
friend of yours there—Mr. Meryon.”</p>

<p>“What? Gambling Meryon? You don’t
say!” exclaimed Lucian. “I’ll look him up. I
haven’t seen him since he won sixteen thousand
off me at a sitting. Lordy! what a getting
down-stairs that was!”</p>

<p>“So he told me.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the whole thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What, about Marguerite?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Lucian, and whistled a few notes.
“Well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Dolly,
conscious that his bright inquisitive eyes were
studying her face.</p>

<p>“Does it make any difference?”</p>

<p>“No. Yes,” said Dolly. “I am very, very
sorry.”</p>

<p>“If I’d thought you’d take it that way,”
said Lucian, swinging himself up to a seat on the
sill, “I’d have given you the whole history
myself, and made it most awfully pathetic. I
bet Meryon didn’t pile it on half strong
enough.”</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly callous!”</p>

<p>“My dear good girl, it’s nine years ago,” said
Lucian, “and there’s no sentiment about me,
at my age. Hullo! whom have we here?”</p>

<p>Dolly looked up from the churn and saw a
stranger coming up the path. He was a young
man of six or seven and twenty, tall, fair, slender,
very good-looking, and most correctly
dressed. At first glance Dolly saw a resemblance
to her last night’s acquaintance, Angela
Laurenson. He had the same fair hair,
the same dark-grey eyes, and the same delicate
and colourless type of features, though his were
more regular, his nose in particular being accurately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Greek; but the likeness appeared only
in the outward mould, Angela’s alertness being
replaced by an air of languid tranquillity. He
was carrying his bag and a gold-headed cane,
and seemed to find the cane alone quite as much
as he wished to support.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said; “could you
direct me to The Hall?”</p>

<p>“Go back to our gates and turn to the right,
straight on till you come to four cross-roads;
take the left-hand road up the hill, and you
will see The Hall on your right, a white house
among fir-trees,” said Dolly, who had the masculine
power of concise explanation.</p>

<p>“About how far is it?”</p>

<p>“Two miles and a quarter.”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much,” said the stranger,
with a resigned air, preparing to go.</p>

<p>“Been walking far?” inquired Lucian, who
had not failed to notice the dust on his boots.</p>

<p>“From Wemborne. I missed my train and
could get no cab,” said the stranger, mentioning
a junction twelve miles away.</p>

<p>“Why, man, you must be dog-tired! Have
you had any breakfast?”</p>

<p>The stranger smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“We shall be very glad if you will come in
and share ours. It is ready now,” said Dolly,
simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks very much. I am particularly
grateful, but I’m afraid I can’t wait.”</p>

<p>“Have some cider; I can recommend it,”
said Lucian, hospitably.</p>

<p>“Or a glass of milk,” suggested Dolly, maternally
careful of his health.</p>

<p>“You are very good,” said the stranger. “I
am rather thirsty.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have some cider, then?”</p>

<p>“No, no cider, thanks. But I should very
much like the milk.”</p>

<p>Dolly went away to fetch it, and the stranger’s
eyes followed her with involuntary admiration.</p>

<p>“What a confounded nuisance these Wemborne
trains are!” said Lucian, who knew the
time-table considerably better than the porters
at the station. “They leave you two
minutes to catch your connection, and then
make the main-line train half an hour late!”</p>

<p>“I could have caught mine,” said the stranger,
with the hint of a smile, “if I had chosen
to run for it. But it was such a fag, you know.”</p>

<p>“You like walking twelve miles better than
running twelve yards?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I put it to myself in
that form,” said the stranger; “but I own that
I don’t like hurrying. I could take my time
over the twelve miles, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve done it in pretty good time,” said
Lucian. “Three hours, or less.”</p>

<p>“Nearer eight, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“You came by the early train?”</p>

<p>“No, by the late.”</p>

<p>“Ye towers o’ Julia!” was Lucian’s irrelevant
comment on this admission.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that I got lost in the dark,”
explained the stranger. “I seemed to meet
the same duck-pond several times. Thank
you very much. I am immensely obliged to
you.” He took from Dolly’s hand the warm
and foaming milk, drank it, and went on his
way, walking, as Lucian now noticed, slightly
lame, but gracefully still, as he went up the
steep, stony path. Dolly said, watching him
with softened eyes, as she sometimes watched
Lucian: “He looks tired to death. I am sure
he is not strong.”</p>

<p>“Maternal spirit! You were born to be a
nurse, Dolly.”</p>

<p>“No. I never want to nurse women or
children, but I am sorry for men, especially
when they are plucky, as he is. I wonder who
he can be?”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Lucian. “I’d also like to
know why he shied so violently at the notion
of cider. I dare say we shall hear.”</p>

<p>They left off talking by common consent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
The entrance of the stranger had checked and
turned their thoughts, and, strangely enough,
seemed to dislocate their simple and friendly
relation. Dolly took out her butter, pulled
down her sleeves, and turned her attention to
the bacon. When she broke silence it was to
speak of a fresh subject, one which she had not
meant to broach that morning, though it had
been on her mind since the night before.</p>

<p>“Mr. de Saumarez, will you take a message
from me to Mr. Farquhar?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, only I’ve a kind of idea
that he’d rather you told him yourself.”</p>

<p>“No, but I would not. I don’t wish to see
him again for the present. I don’t wish to see
him for three months.”</p>

<p>“Three months!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s a long time, Dolly.”</p>

<p>“Not long for what I want to do.”</p>

<p>“Make up your mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can’t see why you shouldn’t do that now.
Farquhar’s what I should call eligible building-ground;
you might erect a cathedral on him,
or you might run up a slave-market; anyhow,
he’ll be what you make him, Dolly.”</p>

<p>“I certainly sha’n’t make anything of him
if you go on praising him. You ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
know that praise is the strongest of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: disqualifications" id="tn-4">disqualifications.</ins>”</p>

<p>“You’re an unreasonable being. If you
don’t see him, how do you think you’re going
to know your own mind better three months
hence than now?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that. I don’t want to see
him; but if he cares to write to me I’ll answer
his letters. That’s what I want you to tell
him.”</p>

<p>“Glory!” said Lucian. “Then while he’s
away I’ll walk in daily and praise him up to
the skies. I think I read my title clear to a
gay time.”</p>

<p>“I want you to go, too,” said Dolly.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’m a harmless individual; you
needn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“But I want to put you both on an equality
and judge fairly.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you’ll never marry me.”</p>

<p>The sincerity of conviction was in Lucian’s
voice; Dolly had that one fleeting glimpse into
his fundamental creed. While he lived he
would never give up hope, but behind it he
accepted the certainty that no hope of his
would ever find fulfilment; such indelible characters
had failure written upon his spirit. Dolly
pitied him so much that she was almost ready
to contradict his creed by the promise of herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Almost, but not quite; the shadow of
the change which she had felt that morning
interfered to prevent her. Better to wait, she
thought; better to deliberate and weigh, not
act on the impulse of a mood. She did not
speak, and Lucian’s golden chance passed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I shall marry you
or not,” she said. “I’ll write to you both; and
at the end of the three months I’ll let you know,
if you still care. There’s Bernard.”</p>

<p>It was not Bernard, however; Bernard was
very late that morning. For the space of half
an hour those two, who felt that their interview
should have been neatly rounded off by the
entrance of a third person, were forced to make
conversation in the regions of small talk. Real
life is not often appropriate in its arrangement
of incidents. Eight o’clock struck before
Bernard walked in, large and calm and hungry.
Lucian disburdened himself of his message,
which was merely an invitation to play
billiards.</p>

<p>“I guess Farquhar must be pretty sick of
teaching me,” said Bernard, cutting himself
a round off the loaf; after which he supplied
Dolly’s needs. “But I suppose he knows his
own business best. I say, did you see that
girl who took me in to supper last night?”</p>

<p>“Dinner, Bernard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p>“Dinner, then. Did you see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Who was she?” asked Lucian.</p>

<p>“Miss Angela Laurenson.”</p>

<p>“Pretty girl, very smart, woman’s rights,
little aristocrat; yes, I know. Go ahead, Colossus;
what about her?”</p>

<p>“I guess the dude who ran me down’s her
brother; I met him again this morning,” said
Bernard; “that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what was he like?”</p>

<p>“Weedy looking chap in gray, with a drawl
and a carpet-bag.”</p>

<p>“L. L. Laurenson, Esq., Royal Artillery, Distinguished
Service Order,” said Lucian. “I
know him, too, by name; as you would if you’d
ever talked to Angela Laurenson for two minutes
on end. She can’t keep him out of the
conversation.”</p>

<p>“Does she call him Lal?” Dolly asked, curiously.
Lucian nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I talked to her for two hours
on end,” said Bernard, cutting himself another
slice from the loaf; “but she didn’t mention
him.”</p>

<p>“What did you talk about?”</p>

<p>“Me,” said Bernard, “and her. Pass me a
couple of eggs, will you, Dolly?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI<br><br>
<span class="fs80">IN ARDEN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">The breast of a wooded hill, leaning towards
water still as glass and green as malachite,
confronted the Hôtel des Boërs, at Vresse-sur-Semois.
Dark-green and silver, the valley
lay below; a nightingale was singing in the
dawn; and presently the gold eye of the sun,
looking down through the high woods, shone
on hills white with dew, spangling them with
fiery drops, and changing into silver threads
the little singing streams which tumbled down
through bright-green dells to join the silent
river. Mists cleared away like breath from a
mirror, and there on the water a little lawny
islet lay like an anchored dream; they had been
cutting the hay, and from the grey swaths
floated up the odours of Eden. Thus rose Lucian’s
first day in Arden, and he was up to see
the dawn.</p>

<p>Farquhar had gone on some weeks before
to complete his arrangements. Having been
brought up by his Scotch relations near Aberdeen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
he knew a good deal about granite, and
on his first visit of inspection had pointed out
that in texture, grain, and colour the stone of
the Petit-Fays quarry resembled the valuable
red granite of Peterhead. The owner simply
laughed him to scorn, and went about lauding
his scrupulous honesty at the expense of his
sense in a fashion which afforded a subtle gratification
to the person praised. Nevertheless,
Farquhar persisted in buying the quarry, and
soon proved himself right. At once he brought
over new, modern machinery, and sent for
skilled workmen from England. His design
was to supply the Belgian market, which had
heretofore been satisfied with Scotch granite.
Paving-stones, better finished than those turned
out by the primitive quarries of the Meuse;
polished shop-fronts for the new suburbs of
Brussels, especially the splendid streets near
the Boulevard d’Anspach: these he could tender
at lower prices than the Scotch dealers, for
in Belgium labour is cheap and the cost of transport
light, especially on the state railways. For
the present he retained his English workmen,
with the intention of replacing them by Belgians
so soon as they had learned the niceties
of their trade; and for this purpose he had already
formed classes for instruction in polishing
and sculpture. His manager, an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
named Charlesworth, had the teaching of them,
and Lucian had promised to give his services as
well.</p>

<p>The quarry, which was already in full work,
lay behind the bend of the Semois, just out of
sight of the hotel. In Belgium one looks for
the grubbily picturesque, for endless variations
on the themes of dirt and art, rather than for
the beauty of rock and wood and river; yet
here in the south the streams run through the
loneliest, loveliest valleys, abandoned to their
kingfishers and great butterflies, and musical
with little springs which run among the hills.
The quarries are hardly eyesores. The approaches
of Farquhar’s were even picturesque; the
intractable granite, interrupting with its fire-scarred
shoulders the suave contour of the
hills, had scattered rocks across the stream,
which reared in a white ruff round each and
raced away with plenty of noise and foam.
The stately cliff which the quarrymen were
labouring to destroy rose up behind from among
trees. Lucian, who never loved his bed, by six
o’clock had had his breakfast and was standing
on the verge, looking down into the pit. It
was unbeautiful; blackened like a hollow tooth
by the smoke of the blasting, swarming with
midget figures, the rocks fell away down to the
depth, where the blocks of granite were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
split up for convenience of loading. The
graceful, deliberate crane let sink its trucks
to be filled, and as slowly raised each to its appointed
bourn; the noise of the steam crusher,
where the chips were being ground to powder
for cement, went on continuously; the boring-machine
was also at work; and four or five
men, splitting up a large block of granite, were
playing “The Bluebells of Scotland” by striking
on drills of different tones.</p>

<p>Presently the whistle of a siren silenced the
music, and with one accord the quarrymen left
their work and took shelter. Five minutes
later, a detonation and strong reverberations
shook the cliff; and when the smoke cleared,
Lucian saw fresh boulders lying displaced from
their bed, and a fresh scar graven upon the
corrugated walls. So the work went on. Danger
was always present; but the danger of the
quarry is not like the loathsome sleuth-hound
of disease which tracks down the potter and
the worker in lead. It is a sudden and violent
peril, which leaps out like a lion and strikes
down its victim in the midst of life. Day by
day the quarryman deliberately stakes against
death the dearest of man’s gifts; it is not surprising
that for other stakes he is a gambler,
too.</p>

<p>There was an accident even as Lucian watched.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
A young Belgian neglected to obey the
warning of the siren, and was overtaken. After
the fumes and smoke had cleared, his mates
went down and found him lying unconscious,
little injured, but stupefied by the poisonous
gases which the explosion had set free. A
crowd came together, Farquhar among them,
barely distinguishable by the eye, though the
tone of his voice came up with surprising clearness.
The lad was carried away, and work
went on again; but Lucian was now all on fire
to join the toilers and take his share in their
risks. Most excitable men fall disinterestedly
in love with danger at least once in their lives;
Lucian himself had done so before, and had
stopped a mad dog scare by picking up in his
arms the supposed terror, an extremely depressed
but perfectly sane fox-terrier. For
this piece of uncalculated bravado he had consistently
and correctly disclaimed the title of
heroism, of course in vain. He turned now
and marched gaily down the path, with the
intention of falling to work at once; but midway
down he encountered Farquhar, with
Charlesworth, the quarry-master, and was
stopped for introduction.</p>

<p>Smith Charlesworth was a huge man who
would have balanced Bernard Fane upon a
see-saw; he dwarfed Farquhar’s excellent proportions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
His bronzed countenance might have
been hammered out of the granite which he surveyed,
without any great skill on the part of
the craftsman; but it inspired confidence. His
slow, soft voice and deliberate movements
built up the notion of strength; and Lucian had
not heard him speak two sentences before he
knew that he liked him. Here was a man
whose calm courage was not at the mercy of
his nerves; a man also of stern rectitude, by
nature narrow, but broadened into tolerance by
experience.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a bad business about that young
chap,” he was saying: “but what can you expect?
It was his own fault. They’ve got industry
but no method. Here’s Mr. Farquhar
thinks they’re going to turn out A1 copper-bottomed
sculptors, but I guess he’ll find his
error. They haven’t got it in ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve just got to put it in,” said Farquhar,
good-humouredly. He was on his best
behaviour, saying not a word that was genuine,
and consequently his conversation was
dull.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the quarry?” Lucian
asked.</p>

<p>“First rate.” Charlesworth stepped to the
edge of the pit and stood there calm as a rock,
with the square toes of his big boots projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
into the air. He pointed to the dark buttress
behind which the boring-machine was at work.
“See that? That’s the finest sample I’ve seen
out of Scotland. You mark my words; in five
years you’ll be sending shipments right out to
the States, and they’ll take all you’ve got and
ask for more. Mr. Farquhar’s begun the right
way; he’s put plenty money in the concern and
he’ll take plenty out—always providing we
don’t get sent to kingdom come first.”</p>

<p>Farquhar laughed at this last idea, but Lucian
asked an explanation. The American
impressed him as a very careful speaker, not
given to random words.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Charlesworth, stroking his chin,
“these chaps here don’t take to your Britishers,
and that’s the bed-rock fact.”</p>

<p>“What’s going to happen, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I guess we shall be running into some dirt
before long.”</p>

<p>“Most pacific nation in the world, the Belgians,”
said Lucian, cheerfully. “Been fought
over so many times that they haven’t a
ha’porth of kick left in them.”</p>

<p>“Yes; good square fighting’s not in their line.
It’s the stab in the dark they go in for,” said
the American, drily. “Two-thirds of the continental
anarchists hail from Brussels. I’ve run
Dutchmen and I’ve run Kanakas, and I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
I can make out to put up with these stiff-necked
Britishers of yours; but the Belgian mongrels
are enough to make an oyster sick. However,
the crew’s not my affair; and if Mr. Farquhar’s
satisfied, why, so am I. And I hope I may be
wrong.”</p>

<p>Charlesworth was no croaker; having given
his warning he left the matter, and they went
down into the quarry talking of possibilities
rather than of presentiments. Lucian could
not see the grounds of his forebodings; the men
seemed friendly, both with the manager and
between themselves, and they were certainly all
that is gracious to him personally. Lucian
thought in French when he spoke to a Frenchman.</p>

<p>They stayed all day at the quarry, taking
lunch in the engine-room on slim little sausages
and beer. Later on, Lucian assisted at the
modelling class, acting as interpreter for Charlesworth,
who could not always find the right
technical terms. He was a strict master, extreme
to mark what was done amiss. “I’ve no
opinion of soft jobs,” he said to Lucian, who had
stood listening to what seemed a very harsh
rebuke for a very small fault on the part of an
elderly English workman who had taken Lucian’s
fancy. “Keep them up to the mark,
that’s my motto. I never will tolerate scamping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Give me good work and I’ll give you good
wages; but if a man don’t handle the tools the
way he ought, why, he can go! and good riddance,
say I.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right for you, with your confounded
meticulous correctitude and exactitude,
my friend,” said Lucian, still vicariously sore;
“but how would you feel if you knew that
the worst work they put in was head and
shoulders better than the best work you put
in?”</p>

<p>“I guess I should turn to and take a hand
at something I could do.”</p>

<p>“And suppose you were incompetent all
round?”</p>

<p>Charlesworth turned and looked at him.
Lucian, laughing, appeared hardened and insouciant,
but the American was slow to judge.
“Well, I don’t say I’m right,” he said; “and
I don’t say you’re wrong. But I couldn’t do
with your way, and I guess you couldn’t do
with mine.”</p>

<p>“There are nine-and-sixty ways of constructing
tribal lays, and every single one of
them is right,” quoted Lucian, coughing.</p>

<p>“You toddle home; the siren will go in half
an hour, and this air’s bad for your cough,”
said Farquhar, coming up and putting his hand
on Lucian’s shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Shut up, you prophet! you thing of evil!
I haven’t coughed once this day.”</p>

<p>“There you err; I’ve heard you twice, myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t once, is it?”</p>

<p>They laughed, and Farquhar shook him by
the shoulder, apostrophizing him as a fool.
“It’s reeking damp here by the water; you’ll
be laid up if you aren’t careful.”</p>

<p>“You want me to see your dinner’s ready,
that’s what it is,” said Lucian, going. Charlesworth
looked at Farquhar. “Sick?” he asked,
with a backward nod.</p>

<p>“No constitution at all.”</p>

<p>“I should put a bullet through my head if it
was me,” said Charlesworth, briefly. “This
world’s not made for incompetents.” But,
luckily for the peace of the quarry, Farquhar
did not hear what he said.</p>

<p>Lucian went to the Hôtel des Boërs and
flirted with Laurette, the charmingly pretty
maid, as he smoked on the veranda. He
shared Dolly’s opinion that a kiss or two did
not matter to any one, and he carried his views
into practice, which she did not. This was
not heroic, but Lucian had many commonplace
failings which disqualified him for the post of
hero. He was still living at Farquhar’s expense;
he had brought into this present undertaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
nothing but his knowledge of modelling.
Yet he accepted his position and was in the
main content. The timely sale of a couple of
short stories had permitted him to buy the
clothes which he was wearing and to pay his
journey over, otherwise he would have euphemistically
borrowed from Farquhar. Little
debts such as that galled him; but the main
burden sat lightly on his shoulders, which was
well; for, as he told himself with obstinate pride
when visited by the pricks of self-contempt, he
had consistently done his best and had failed
not through his own fault.</p>

<p>The evening set the pattern of many evenings
following. Charlesworth came in with
Farquhar to dinner; he had been lodging at
Petit-Fays, but now talked of transferring himself
to the hotel, which, though as primitive
as the pious farmers whose name it bore, was
certainly cleaner than they. The dinner made
Farquhar sigh for the flesh-pots of England; he
permitted himself to be a bon-vivant, to tone
down his excessive virtues. Sorrel soup, beefsteak
which never grew on an ox, tongue
stewed with cherries, and a <em>baba</em> made by the
eldest son of the house, who was a pâtissier;
this was the menu. Now a <em>baba</em> is a kind of
sponge-cake soaked in rum and sweet as
saccharine: Charlesworth would not touch it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Farquhar ate a morsel and did not want any
more, but Lucian, with the whimsical appetite
of an invalid, was only deterred from clearing
the dish by Farquhar’s solemn assurance that
it would make him tipsy. Such was their
meal, finished off by a cup of excellently strong
black coffee, which they drank on the veranda
as they smoked and talked. The night was
dark, still, and starry; the huge, soft, shadowy
hills shut out all wandering airs, and the river
passed them silent, gleamless. But close beside
them a wooden trough guided down the water
of a spring which rose among the moss of the
steep hill-orchard, and the loquacious little
fount made an irregular sibilant accompaniment
for their voices. Laurette’s young brothers, shy
but friendly, hovered round the door listening
to the strange foreign talking, anxious only to
be allowed to be useful. The Ardennois are
hospitable folk.</p>

<p>Farquhar was thinking of building a small
house; he had interviewed a local architect,
who proffered him weird designs for a maisonette
after the style of the Albert Memorial, with
multitudinous tourelles and pinnacles picked
out in red and white and blue, and liberally
gilded. Refusing this gorgeous domicile, he
was beset with advice from Lucian and from
Charlesworth, each of whom professed to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
something about architecture; though Lucian’s
counsels recalled the wise saw that a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing, especially in
ceilings, and seemed likely to afford a modern
instance of a castle in the air. The talk became
more personal. They were all travellers:
Lucian the most inveterate, for he had wandered
the world across. Farquhar could speak
familiarly of Africa; Charlesworth of the States
and the South Seas, where for several years he
had traded with a schooner of his own, until
a drunken pilot kept Christmas by sinking her
off Butaritari, in the Gilberts. Charlesworth’s
voice softened when he spoke of the Islands,
which had set their spell upon him; but there
was little softness in it when he mentioned
that pilot. His talk was deeply coloured by the
sea, but he had when he chose the address of
a gentleman. He was married, he said: had
married a clever Boston girl, grown tired of high
culture, who sailed with him till the <i>Golden
Horn</i> met her watery fate, and who was now
teaching school in California at a salary of
two hundred dollars a month. She put by
every cent she could spare, and he was doing
the same, until they had saved enough to
return to the South Seas. “For,” said Charlesworth,
“there’s nothing draws you like the
Islands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p>“Islands have a special fascination, I suppose,”
said Lucian, thinking of Guernsey.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s right enough out here, but England’s
the place for me,” said Farquhar, pushing
back his chair. “Come to bed, De
Saumarez; it’s time for all good little boys to
turn in.”</p>

<p>Lucian settled back into his seat. “Go
away: I won’t be mussed up! I believe you’re
simply thirsting to flesh your clinical on me.”</p>

<p>“Not I. I’ve done enough nursing since
December to last me my life.”</p>

<p>“Very good for you,” said Lucian, lighting
a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>Farquhar watched his chance and snatched
it. Lucian was up in a moment, and there was a
scrimmage in which he did not conquer; whereupon
he lifted up his voice and wailed aloud,
to the amazement of Charlesworth, who was
not used to Lucian’s ways. “I want my
cigar!” was the burden of his complaint, repeated
with variations.</p>

<p>“Go to bed and you shall have it,” said
Farquhar, laughing and wary.</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“You’re unreasonable. Why shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be shot if I’ll give in to an arrogant
brute like you! Besides, I want to wait for the
post.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, the post,” said Farquhar, with a
singular change of tone. He dropped the
cigar and sat down. He did not look at
Lucian, but Lucian shot a glance at him, and
both were silent. Charlesworth stared. The
constraint lasted for a moment. Then, pat
to the occasion, Laurette came out with the
letters. Farquhar half rose and put out his
hand, but she passed him by for Lucian. “Pour
monsieur.” The amazed Charlesworth saw
rapidly varying expressions flit over both faces:
anger, jealousy, triumph, rancour: and then
Laurette, after rubbing her hand clean on her
skirt, turned and held out to Farquhar the
exact facsimile of Lucian’s small grey envelope.
“Et pour monsieur, encore une.”</p>

<p>Farquhar took his letter, and Charlesworth
took himself home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br><br>
<span class="fs80">AND WILT THOU LEAVE ME THUS?</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">There were eight young Laurensons, of
whom the two youngest were Laurence
Lionel, commonly known as Lal, and Angela.
Angela was the only girl, and had been spoilt,
or rather given her own way; but then, that
way was always exemplary. She had done her
best for all her brothers, she said, with pathos,
yet Bertie still remained a dude and Harold
still a fool, and with none of them had she
succeeded save with Lal, who was a pattern of
virtue. Angela bade him work for the army,
enter Woolwich, and pass into the Royal
Engineers; he obeyed her by coming out first
in his batch. After this they had a slight difference
of opinion, for Lal chose to enter the
Royal Artillery and would not be dissuaded
from it by all the accusations of laziness which
his guardian angel hurled at his head. She
did not know, and nobody else noticed, that
a certain poor country parson’s son, who after
patient toil had attained only the eighteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
place on the list, was by Lal’s retirement elevated
among the lucky seventeen to be drafted
into the Engineers—the only regiment where a
penniless man can live on his pay. Lal’s choice
remained a puzzle to Angela. But Lal was
queer; she was sure that her deepest soundings
never quite touched bottom.</p>

<p>Lal entered at once upon a distinguished
career. During the South African war he was
twice mentioned in despatches, received the Distinguished
Service Order, and was never taken
prisoner: three grand distinctions which made
the guardian angel proudly preen her wings.
She had cried herself to sleep every night of the
first week after he sailed. In Somaliland he got
enteric and was wounded in the foot; he was
invalided home amid a blaze of glory with six
months’ sick leave and another medal to hang
beside the two which a liberal Conservative
War Office had already bestowed for his services
in Africa. He sustained the character
of wounded hero with fortitude, but without
enjoyment: Lal was modest. Admiration silenced
him; he had been more open with Bernard,
a stranger who did not know him, than
he had ever been with his sister. He made a
vaguely impressive figure at Ella Merton’s
garden-parties: a quiet, languid, fair-haired
young aristocrat, always very correctly dressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
always courteous, always reticent. Maud
Prideaux, who had names for everybody, hit
off the Laurensons’ peculiarities to a nicety
when she christened Angela <i>On dit</i> and her
brother <i lang="fr">Cela va sans dire</i>.</p>

<p>Angela Laurenson had views; she had also a
first-class dressmaker. These sentences are
not gems from a German grammar, but the
statement of correlated facts; the first would
never have been in evidence but for the second.
The temperance question, the rights of women,
public scandals, and private fads were Angela’s
happy hunting-grounds. She was member of a
dozen associations, and corresponded with a
dozen wooden-headed boards. She had chased
the Protestant donkey to his home in a mare’s-nest.
Sweeping into one condemnation offenders
against manners and morals, she declined
to know wicked noblemen, whitewashed
ladies, grocery knights, and Chicago millionaires.
In fact, her fair little thin face, her clear little
imperious voice, her perfectly simple and simply
perfect frocks were pretty widely known; and
in spite of certain errors, she was respected.</p>

<p>In the fore-front of her battles she always
posted Lal. He was not allowed to smoke.
He would have been enrolled in the Ladies’
League had that been possible. He was constrained
to become what in temperance language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
is called an abstainer: which was especially hard
on Lal, who inherited a delicate critical taste in
wines together with an ancestral cellar. But
he disliked these things less than being dragged
to meetings and forced to sing “Dare to be a
Daniel” upon a platform. Lal hated publicity:
not the lion, but the lookers-on, seemed to him
the real test of Daniel’s courage. If anything
could have held him back from distinguishing
himself in action, it would have been the fear of
reward.</p>

<p>Now one day at lunch the story of Mrs.
Searle and her copper came up, and was discussed
in all its ramifications, down to the
illness of Mrs. Searle’s baby and Noel Farquhar’s
political prospects. Angela, who was
present, took it into her pretty little head
that duty called her to visit the sick child.
Like most city-bred girls, she expected the
country lanes to be haunted by drunken
tramps, and was nervous of walking alone; but
Maud Prideaux vowed that babies were beyond
her charity, and Mrs. Merton, who was enthusiastically
consulting planchette in a corner
with a serious young man, professed a bad
headache. Angela fell back on Lal; and, accordingly,
at three o’clock they were walking
towards Burnt House, Lal irreproachable in
grey, with lilies in his button-hole; Angela, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
in grey, a demure little Quakeress. The sky
was in grey as well, and mist clung to the face
of the earth like fine grey powder, dulling all
colours. The flattened uplands round the black
cottages were as dingy as a suburban street on
a wet day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Searle was at the new copper, trying
to do the family wash; but between the
naughtiness of Randolph, aged thirteen months,
the frettiness of Florry, aged twenty days, and
her own health, she had not done much. She
was not at first very gracious; poor people
have their feelings, and the attitude of Angela,
with her skirts unconsciously held very high
to avoid contamination, suggested the supercilious
patronage of the lady bountiful. But
Angela’s kindness was too homely to remain
hidden under a Paris hat; she soon received
the story of Mrs. Searle’s illness and the baby’s
delicacy: “but we’re getting on nicely now,”
the girl added, leaning against the copper and
holding the brickwork to keep herself steady,
the lovely, pathetic brown eyes uncomplainingly
lifted to Angela’s. She said she had at first
fed the baby on Brighton biscuit and boiled
bread, beaten up in water.</p>

<p>“Brighton biscuit?” said Angela, doubtfully,
looking, with no feeling but repulsion, at
the purplish, spidery, open-mouthed creature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
in its tumbled clothes. “Is that good for it,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Dolly she says give her milk
and barley-water, but the milkman don’t
come up here. So I tried her with the condensed,
and it’s wonderful how she’s got on
since.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the milkman to bring you up a
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: gallon a day,’”" id="tn-5">gallon a day,”</ins> said Angela, with a small
sigh relinquishing a silver blotting-book which
she had coveted. “That will be enough for
it, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure you <em>are</em> kind—”</p>

<p>“And couldn’t you get a woman in to help
you? You’re not fit to be doing your own
work yet.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly Mrs. Searle melted into tears,
not for her own misfortunes, and poured forth
the tale of her sister Hilda, who should have
been her help, but had got into trouble. Not
yet seventeen, very pretty, and now desperate,
she was gone to a low public-house in Swanborough.
“Mr. Searle he can’t get her to come
away, and I can’t get so far, you see. And
really, miss, some days I don’t know how to
crawl about, my back is that bad; only things
has got to be done somehow. I did think
Hilda would have kept straight. Or she might
have stopped at home till my trouble was over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
I told her as nobody would think the worse
of her if it was just once, as you may say, and
she kept herself respectable after; but there,
you never know how to have girls, and off
she goes, as bold as brass, and me so ill I
couldn’t say nothing to her—”</p>

<p>Angela sighed impatiently; none of her pet
reforms touched Mrs. Searle’s case; no reforms
ever do. The celebrated last words of
the poor woman who always was tired, who
lived in a house where help was not hired,
represent the aspirations of most cottage
mothers, night by night, until the children
are grown old enough to help them. Angela
did her best; she promised a nurse, and left a
half-crown; and then walked out upon Dolly
Fane, who was talking to Lal. They were
standing so close to the door that Angela knew
Lal must have overheard Mrs. Searle’s story,
and the colour came into her face as she took
Dolly’s hand. She forgot to be surprised to
find them acquainted until Dolly in her direct
fashion told her of their early meeting; when
Angela did not forget to feel annoyed.</p>

<p>Nor was she better pleased when Dolly, entering
the cottage, quieted Randolph and
prescribed for the baby and put Mrs. Searle
into a chair, proving herself efficient where
Angela had just proved herself incapable. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
was all done in innocence, and innocent, too,
was Dolly’s laugh when she heard of the
liberal provision of milk allotted for the baby,
for Mrs. Searle had not mentioned the giver;
nevertheless, Angela decided that she was not
a nice companion for Lal.</p>

<p>“We shall be late for tea, Lal,” she whispered,
suggestively.</p>

<p>“Miss Fane will be ready directly.”</p>

<p>“Not for half an hour or so; I am going to
finish these things in the copper,” said Dolly,
appearing at the door in a large apron and
with her sleeves rolled up. No inclement
clouds could dim the brilliancy of her colouring;
she was independent of sun and sky.
But Angela became conscious that her own
face looked drab, and that did not please
her.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind walking home alone I
think I’ll stay and help Miss Fane; these cans
are very heavy,” said Lal, depriving Dolly
of that she was carrying.</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> mind walking home alone, across all
those fields!”</p>

<p>“It really is not lonely, Angela.”</p>

<p>“But there are bulls in them!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Miss Laurenson, the cows have
been driven home to be milked by now,” said
Dolly, serenely; “you need not be alarmed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
But I don’t want any help; I hope Mr. Laurenson
won’t stay for me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you as far as the high-road, then,
and come back,” said Lal.</p>

<p>Dolly put up her eyebrows and laughed
softly. “I’m perfectly competent to do the
work myself; these cans weigh nothing.” She
held it out at arm’s-length and lightly put it
down, rising again elastic from the burden.</p>

<p>“You’re accustomed to the work, of course,”
said Angela, dryly.</p>

<p>“I am; we do our own washing at home.”</p>

<p>“If you want to be in by four, we had better
start,” Lal interposed.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Angela, not offering her
hand; was not Dolly’s wet?</p>

<p>“Pray don’t come back, Mr. Laurenson;
there are so many bad characters about the
roads now; you might meet my brother Bernard!”
Dolly retorted, with a faintly satirical
accent.</p>

<p>“I certainly shall,” said Lal, quietly.</p>

<p>Between Burnt House and the high-road Lal
received a full-length portrait of his misconduct;
he listened, as his habit was, in silence.
Angela soon tired of reproving a dummy.
“Why don’t you say something?” she cried at
last.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to go back to that <em>girl</em>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do.”</p>

<p>“O Lal!” said Angela. “Oh, do you really?”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave her with that work on her
hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—Lal, I don’t like walking alone!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Angela, but I promised.”</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Fane,” cried Angela, in a
note of relief, and she hurried to meet him.
Bernard in his working clothes was something
of a shock to her nerves, but she got
over it and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>“We’ve left your sister at the black cottages,
Mr. Fane,” she began, “and my brother wanted
to go back and help her—”</p>

<p>“And my sister is a little nervous in these
lanes,” Lal continued, “so that if you would
be so good as to see her as far as The Hall, I
should be very grateful. It is on your way,
I know.”</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: ‘I’d like to" id="tn-6">“I’d like to</ins> very much,” said Bernard,
promptly.</p>

<p>“Thanks so much. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and walked off, leaving
Angela speechless and ready to cry; for she had
not desired Lal’s presence with her so much as
his absence from Dolly, and that Lal knew,
and she knew that he knew. However, it was
not easy to embarrass Bernard; he talked on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
for both till she had recovered. “Ah,” thought
Angela, coming back to the remembrance of
her escort, “here is some one who will not
flout and contradict me and fling my own
axioms in my face!”</p>

<p>“That chap Searle, now,” Bernard was
saying when next his word reached her brain:
“he’s a good worker; he might get on if he
liked; but he will drink. Comes home every
Saturday night drunk as a lord. What are
you to do with a chap like him?”</p>

<p>“He should be persuaded to take the pledge,”
said Angela, reviving a little to discuss one of
her favourite hobbies.</p>

<p>“Oh, the teetotal tomfoolery; no, I guess that
wouldn’t do for him. What he wants is to
know when to pull up.”</p>

<p>“Teetotal—nonsense?” said Angela, avoiding
Bernard’s too strong expression. “The
pledge of abstinence is the only safeguard for
an habitual drunkard. I am a total abstainer
myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I guess you didn’t ever drink,”
said Bernard, as one who scores a point.
“Besides, girls don’t want it so much; I daresay
they can do without. But it stands to
reason a man can’t do a decent day’s work
on water. Spirits are no good; they’re mostly
adulterated with beastly stuff, and the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of them isn’t wholesome. But a glass of good,
honest beer don’t do anybody any harm. A
couple of quarts a day, that’s my limit; I
dare say a quart and a half would do for a
little chap like Searle, except, perhaps, in
harvesting. The point is to know your limit
and stick to it, and that he’ll never do, more’s
the pity.”</p>

<p>Angela felt the primitive truths of her life
flying round her like slates in a gale. “But
doctors say—” she was beginning.</p>

<p>“Doctors’ll say anything; and, come this
time ten years, they’ll all say all different.
That old chap in Tennyson, now, who said he’d
have his quart if he died for it; I guess he
didn’t lose much by sticking to his beer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you read Tennyson?” said Angela,
faintly.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, on Sunday afternoons. There
isn’t much to do on the farm, and there’s no
paper, and you can’t read the Bible all day
long; so when I’ve done my chapter I often
turn in on him. I like the things in dialect;
they’re uncommonly good. I like the thing
about the Baptists, who left their sins in the
pond and poisoned the cow,” he continued, with
a grin. “Father lent ’em our pond once, when
he’d had a split with the Wesleyans; but I guess
they won’t come there again to do their baptising.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
It looks as clear as the river, but it’s
about six feet deep in mud.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of starting a branch of the
C. E. T. S. here, and asking you to join it,”
said Angela, with the calmness of despair.</p>

<p>“Me turn teetotaller? I should die of it!”</p>

<p>“Your adherence would have strengthened
my hands, but, of course, since you feel like this,
there is no more to be said.”</p>

<p>“Do <em>you</em> want me to join?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter. I sha’n’t start the
branch now.”</p>

<p>Bernard walked on in silence. Six miles an
hour was his usual rate of walking, four when
with Dolly, or, as he supposed, with any other
able-bodied female; but Angela was used to
crowded London pavements and the very
deliberate pace of lazy Lal. She did not
protest, she was too much out of heart to mind
being out of breath. She sadly supposed that
Bernard was not observant. Great was her
surprise when, remarking, “I guess we’re going
too fast,” he reduced his pace to three miles
an hour and rather doubtfully offered his
arm.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s not the proper thing,” was
his comment when she declined it. “Dolly said
so, but then she doesn’t know everything; and
you do take arms in to dinner. I’ll remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
another time. Look here, are you set on this
temperance business?”</p>

<p>“I think it a noble cause,” said Angela,
wearily standing to her guns.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take the pledge for a month.”</p>

<p>“You will?”</p>

<p>“I guess I couldn’t stand it any longer,”
Bernard explained; “but a month from now’ll
just keep clear of the harvesting. I’d like
to do what you want, as far as is reason.
And here we are. I’m awfully glad to have
met you. You’ll remember I’d like to please
you, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Oh yes, Angela said, she would remember;
and she kept her word, for all the night through
she reflected alternately on Lal’s defection and
on Bernard Fane’s subjection—a word which
she refused to lengthen into subjugation.</p>

<p>Lal, on his way to the black cottages, walked
really fast, but he did not get back in time to
help Dolly with her cans of water; she was
feeding the baby when he came up. Sitting
in a low chair with the child on her knee,
holding the bottle, the delicate little toy fingers
clasped round her own, Dolly, intent and
serious, was no Madonna of pity and love, but a
business-like young woman performing a duty.
But Lal, who was fond of little children, unconsciously
ascribed to her his own feelings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
he saw the divine spirit of motherhood, and
stood quietly watching, too reverent to speak
and break the charm. It was the traitorous
sun, suddenly bursting out to throw Lal’s
shadow on the floor, which made Dolly look
up. She smiled. She had forgotten her vexation,
and was frankly glad to see him, yet her
first words were a reproach.</p>

<p>“Why did you come back? Your sister
hated it, and there was no need!”</p>

<p>“I came to help you.”</p>

<p>“It was a pity. Your sister is very fond
of you, very proud; you should not vex her,”
Dolly said, laying the child in the cradle. She
rose and came to the door, and stood in the
hot sunshine, rich in colour as a Tintoretto,
spiritual as the crowned Madonna of the angelical
painter. She was still thinking of Mrs.
Searle, and pity was Dolly’s loveliest expression.</p>

<p>“I left my sister in the charge of your brother;
he was going to see her home. Now will you
accuse me of vexing her? Or are you going to
give me something to do?”</p>

<p>“You may watch the baby while I sweep the
room.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I will sweep the room while you
watch the baby.”</p>

<p>“You? You sweep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Have you ever swept in your life?”</p>

<p>“I have not; but I can try.”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well,” said Dolly, suddenly
folding her hands and sitting down in her low
chair. “Do it: there’s the broom behind the
door. Do it: I should love to see you.”</p>

<p>The road outside was far cleaner than the
floor of Mrs. Searle’s kitchen. Lal stood,
doubtfully surveying his task and the aged
broom. “It really wants scrubbing,” he said,
seriously.</p>

<p>“Sweeping will do, if you sweep properly.”</p>

<p>“‘Will do!’ Miss Fane, I am surprised to
hear you use that sloven’s expression. However,
I am afraid sweeping will have to do, as
we have neither sand nor Brooke’s soap.”</p>

<p>Leaving Dolly amazed at his erudition, Lal
made a sudden descent upon the hearth-rug,
shook it, rolled it up, and carried it out. He
took out the cradle as well, very gently putting
it down in the shade without waking the child.
The chairs he piled on the table; the curtains
he tucked up. Dolly took her place outside
with the rest of the furniture, and stood in
the doorway, watching and laughing. Lal
paused, leaning on his broom in the middle
of the floor as Maud Muller might have leaned
upon her hay-rake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly he made a triumphant pounce upon
Mrs. Searle’s brown teapot, which spent all its
days upon the hob. He emptied away the
liquid tea, shook out the leaves on a broken
plate, and began to strew them with fastidious
fingers about the floor: the contrast between
him and his task was piquant. Bernard would
never have attempted to sweep at all, Lucian
might have tried, but he was not wise enough
for the tea-leaf plan. Dolly’s imagination could
see him happily brooming all the dust out of
the open door, and gathering it up with his
fingers when it lodged in the inequalities of the
flooring. This amateur house-maid worked in
different style. Neat, deft, precise, that was
Lal; he coaxed the flue out of the corners, he
lifted the fender and swept underneath, he took
away cobwebs from the window and spiders’
nests from the angles of the ceiling, and swept
all his gleanings into a symmetrical pile.</p>

<p>“A dust-pan, now,” he said, looking round
enquiringly.</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing. Let me do it now:
you’ve proved your powers.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lal; “no.” His eye rested on a
copy of the local paper; in a trice he had it
folded firmly with sharp edges, and was bending
it into a convenient receptacle for the débris,
which he emptied into the fire. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
dusted the furniture with his handkerchief and
put everything back in place, twitching the
ragged hearth-rug straight to the eighth of an
inch and arranging all the chairs in pairs
exactly.</p>

<p>“But it should have been scrubbed,” he
wound up, with a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>“I won’t have it; Mrs. Searle wouldn’t know
her own room. Do you know, I never thought
a man could have so—could be—”</p>

<p>“Could have so much sense,” Lal finished,
quaintly.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t. Where did you learn how
to do it?” said Dolly, laughing.</p>

<p>“Miss Fane, I have a pair of eyes, and our
rooms at home are swept sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you’ve the hands, too.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Lal said, displaying them with
disgust. Dolly looked, with a wise little nod,
and went into the scullery; she brought back
a fresh towel, a piece of yellow soap, and a tin
basin full of clean hot water.</p>

<p>“That is good,” Lal said, plunging in his
hands with an air of relief. Dolly was looking
at her own. “I think I’ll wash, too,” she said;
and without more ado stripped back her cuffs
and slipped her fingers in beside Lal’s. The
sunlight sparkled in the water and flashed in
silver circles, following the curve of the white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
metal. Dolly chased the piece of soap all
round the basin, and Lal captured it and gave
it to her; her wrist was soft to the touch as a
baby’s. Lal was warmly alive to the charm
of the moment, and would have prolonged it; not
so Dolly. She withdrew her hands with the
same indifference as though Bernard had been
her partner. They were obliged to share the
same towel; there were but two in Mrs. Searle’s
establishment.</p>

<p>“What a pussy-cat you are!” Dolly laughed,
noticing Lal’s fastidious movements. “Do you
manicure your hands?”</p>

<p>“I rather think that is a deadly insult. No,
I do not manicure my hands; I am merely clean.”</p>

<p>“Merely clean! You’re hard on the rest of
us.” Dolly was thinking of Lucian as he had
appeared after half an hour of weeding in the
violet-bed. She held out her own hand, soft,
rosy, crinkled by the hot water. “There are
stains on my fingers; I can’t get them off without
taking the skin, too; so I leave them on.
Am I not clean, please?”</p>

<p>Lal was in danger of losing his head, and
kissing the pretty palm that lay in his, “I
don’t see any stains,” he said. Dolly withdrew
it, colouring at his tone. She pulled down her
sleeves, and told herself she was a fool to
forget that men are fools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>

<p>“Do you always do as your sister tells you?”
she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Miss Fane, do you always do as your
brother tells you?”</p>

<p>“I? Not often,” Dolly frankly admitted.
“I do as I like.”</p>

<p>“You’re more independent than I am: I do
what Angela likes, except on serious and
important questions of principle. It saves
so much trouble, you know; I can do no wrong,
like the king.”</p>

<p>“What principle was involved in your
staying this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Lal was dumb, manifestly embarrassed by
this sudden attack.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” Dolly insisted. She was expecting
that he would answer “You,” in
which case she meant to snub him and give
him up. But he remained silent.</p>

<p>“Why did you come back, when your sister
hated it and you hated vexing her, as I know
very well you did?”</p>

<p>“Because I couldn’t stand seeing a girl carry
those heavy cans.”</p>

<p>Dolly had her answer now, and she knew it
was the truth. Lal had coloured over his
admission and cast down his eyes; he should
have looked youthful and ingenuous, but he
did not. A very expressive mouth had Lal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the underlip was remarkably firm, pure, decisive;
tenacity and independence controlled
its curves. One might expect to find originality
in his theory of life, anachronisms in his creed,
possibly asceticism, certainly unworldliness:
in fact, all those queer ideas whose existence
Angela unhappily suspected. So much may
be read in a momentary twist of the lips.
Chivalry here in the twentieth century! Bernard
looked on woman as an inferior animal, Lucian
as a comrade, Farquhar as slave or sultana by
turns: Dolly’s observations and reflections were
summed up in the involuntary remark:</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurenson, how very odd you are!”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Gounod, whose sweet and sensuous church
music has something of the quality of
<em>good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke</em>, has
written some acceptable love-songs; such at
least was Lucian’s opinion. Aided by the
night’s stillness and the seductive influence of
the stream which cradled their boat, Noel
Farquhar’s fine dramatic voice rang up the
valley to the hotel, half a mile away. The
twangs and pangs of Lucian’s banjo did not
travel so far. Farquhar had a powerful voice,
thoroughly well trained; he did not tremble
in sentimental passion and murder time in the
name of liberty, nor yet did he alternately
spue out his words and gobble them down.
And he had fire; he could sing the very heart
out of a song. His native taste in music he
usually sacrificed to the general good; he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
sing “The Lost Chord” and “The Holy City”
and “Beauty’s Eyes,” and other favourites, to
please young ladies such as Angela Laurenson
and elderly gentlemen who like a little music
after dinner. But Lucian laid a taboo on these;
he offered Farquhar the choice between what
he called gamey music (meaning the glorious
modern discords which we all delight to honour
in the abstract) and ditties of the Bank Holiday
school, with a chorus in which he expressed
his desire to join. Whereupon Farquhar hurriedly
embarked upon “Medjé.”</p>

<p>It was a clear night of summer, still and
starry. The stream’s dark glass was filmed
with silver mist which wavered and rose and
receded as if it were the visible vesture of the
wind; the smooth hills, spreading dark wings
over the valley, breathed peace. For sounds
they had the tinkle of the orchard runnel and
the deep breaths of cows wrenching the dewy
grass; and for scents the night perfume of the
water and of the woods, as well as the sweeter
individual smells of flowers: flaxen meadow-sweet,
wild mint blowing purple among the
reeds, and clover in the meadow-grasses.</p>

<p>“A summer night like this is the best imitation
of Paradise this side of the Golden Gates,”
said Lucian, leaning down to watch the ripples
parting silver-rimmed beneath the prow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span></p>

<p>“I’d not give a cent to get into Paradise.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be asked, sonny.”</p>

<p>“There you’re right, for there’s no such place.”</p>

<p>“Your views on eschatology, my friend, appear
demned definite.”</p>

<p>“Definite? Finite, don’t you mean?”</p>

<p>Lucian leaned back and folded his arms restfully;
he liked nothing better than to explore
the recesses of Farquhar’s character, which were
commonly open only after dark.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any intimations of immortality
from the recollections of early childhood?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“None,” said Farquhar. “Never had.
Seventy years of this world’s long enough for
me. I don’t want an eternity to learn to be
good in. Another point: if I believed what you
Christians believe, do you think I’d live as you
live? Not much. Act up to your creed;
there’s the secret of happiness.”</p>

<p>“And what’s your creed, then?”</p>

<p>“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,”
said Farquhar, cynically enjoying his own
cynicism.</p>

<p>“And suppose the workings of Causation
came and put a stopper on your eating and
drinking? If you were brought to grinding
poverty, say, or got infected with leprosy, or
didn’t marry Dolly Fane?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span></p>

<p>“There’s always the ultimate remedy,” said
Farquhar, with a shrug.</p>

<p>“Which means, being interpreted?”</p>

<p>“Suicide while of unsound mind: I’d take
good care it wasn’t called accidental death. I
wonder, now, if they’d give me Christian
burial?”</p>

<p>“Not if I was anywhere around, sonny; you
may depend on that. So you seriously contemplate
suicide as a possible end of your
life?”</p>

<p>“Probable, not possible: I keep my revolver
loaded. I’ve had that before me ever since I
remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give you the credit of being consistent;
only, don’t you include me among the
Christians, for I’m not one. You can put
down my inconsistencies to that if you like.
If I’d owned a creed, I believe I might have
stuck to it—tolerably well.”</p>

<p>“You’re sorry you’ve none?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lucian.</p>

<p>“The Almighty doesn’t seem to know His own
business very well.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you blaspheme,” said Lucian. “I
can’t say I believe that there is a God, but I
know I don’t believe that there isn’t. When
little boys like you are profane, you make me
think of some kids I knew, who had a midnight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
supper in the church-yard to show they
weren’t afraid of bogies. And it rained, and
one got rheumatic fever; that was me,” he
wound up, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Farquhar laughed, and broke off to ask, “Is
that any one calling?”</p>

<p>“Who’d look us up at this time of night,
’cept it was the postman?”</p>

<p>“Are you expecting a letter?”</p>

<p>“I had my weekly budget yesterday, and
so did you, sonny; don’t be jealous.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> jealous; I’m confoundedly jealous.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want, boy?”</p>

<p>“To see your letter.”</p>

<p>Lucian was fully alive to the fascination of
playing with a tiger; he pulled out Dolly’s
grey envelope and played a tune on the back
of it. “Here it is; what do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“I want to know how she addresses you and
signs herself, and what the substance of it’s like,
and how many sheets she sends you.”</p>

<p>“How many does she send you?”</p>

<p>“Curious, too, are you? Exchange, then.”</p>

<p>“Not much. Suppose she called you darling
and me only dear?”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, Lucian, I shouldn’t wonder if I
murdered you in my sleep some night!”</p>

<p>“Did you say in your sleep or in mine?”
Lucian put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>“I’d not do it in my senses, for I’ve no wish
to be hanged for murder; but, I tell you, I can’t
get the thought of those letters of yours out of
my head. And when the will’s in abeyance
the body sometimes works of itself. You keep
your door locked: mind, I’ve warned you.”</p>

<p>“Upon my solemn honour, old Farquhar, you
are a savage!” exclaimed Lucian.</p>

<p>“Take the thing away, then; keep it out of
my sight!”</p>

<p>“I guess you’d read it if you found it lying
about?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, I should. I’d have opened the
envelope yesterday by the steam of the kettle,
only Dolly’d been at the pains to seal it,
confound her!”</p>

<p>Lucian gave him a queer glance. That
cynical confession did not alienate him; for
one thing, he knew that it was necessary to
make a large discount upon Farquhar’s revelations
of iniquity, and for another, had it
been true to the last word it could not have
changed his feeling. Strong, quiet, and immovable,
that lay welded, into his life; it
almost equalled his love for Dolly; it outweighed
his love for himself. He moved to
give his letter to Farquhar, but checked his
hand in mid-air; Dolly’s affectionate words
might so easily be misconstrued by a jealous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
eye. Instead, he plunged the envelope over
the side, and let it float away.</p>

<p>“There goes temptation,” he said, as the
chain of bubbles ended.</p>

<p>“There’ll be others to come, though. There
<em>is</em> some one calling.”</p>

<p>It was Charlesworth hailing them from the
shore; Farquhar took up the oars and rowed
back. The huge figure of the American loomed
up against the twilit sky, quiet as a rock; he
never was impatient.</p>

<p>“Way up at the hotel I heard you singing,
and I made out you must be down here, sir;
higher up the water’s not deep enough to
drown a kitten,” he said, as Farquhar secured
the boat. A stake and a rope were all that was
needed, without bars or locks; theft was unfashionable
at Petit-Fays.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong, is there?” Farquhar asked.</p>

<p>“I’d not go so far as to say that; but I
told you we were running into some dirt, and
it’s come up pretty close.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what’s up, then?”</p>

<p>Charlesworth fell in beside him and told his
tale. The path was narrow, the grass dewy,
and the American had shown pretty plainly
that he took his orders from one master only.
Lucian dropped behind and meekly held his
peace. It appeared that the lad who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
injured was demanding compensation; Charlesworth,
who was ready to give, had refused to
concede; and a venomous little dispute had
sprung up, which was breeding bad blood between
him and the men. Added to this, they
were asking higher wages.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t put up with him, and that’s the
square truth,” Charlesworth frankly acknowledged.
“If he’d come to me and said, ‘I
was knocked silly, and I’ve lost a couple of
weeks; I know I’d no business to be where I
was, and I deserved all I got, but can you do
anything for me?’—then I don’t say but what
I might have turned to and helped him out;
that’s talking. But when he swaggers up and
says, ‘Show us the colour of your money and
be hanged to you, else I’ll make you,’ why, then
I tell him that he’s at liberty to go to Hades if
he likes, but not a red cent shall he get from me.
I don’t know whether that’s your way of doing
business, sir, but I guess it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I’d not have you back
down, don’t think it! I’ve a preference myself
for fighting things out. When was this?”</p>

<p>Farquhar’s words were exemplary, but his
face was less discreet; it was manifest that he
did prefer to fight things out, and Charlesworth,
who laid no claim to the Christian grace
of meekness, hailed a spirit akin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>“This evening, after pay-time. I came right
round to you.”</p>

<p>“What’s the next move to be?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Charlesworth, deliberately: “I
guess it’s me they’ve got a down on now; but
when the time comes they won’t stop to sort
us out. They’re pretty sick about your newfangled
machinery for one thing, and then
there’s the business about the Britishers:
taking one thing with another, and this compensation
racket on the top, you may bet
they’re sure-enough mad. And I’ve no use for
a funeral at present. So before we go any
further, sir, I’d ask you to come round to the
works; for there’s a job there I’d like you to
see.”</p>

<p>He would not explain any further, and the
trio walked on past the gold-litten windows
of the hotel towards the quarry. All was silent
there and dark save for the signal-lamp of the
watchman, sparkling on the brow of the pit
among the constellations high in the dark
sky, like a topaz among diamonds. Picking
their way among the truck lines, which converged
like so many silver cords from all
directions towards the mouth of the quarry,
they came up to the splendid block of granite
marked out by Charlesworth for their first
serious essay in carving. Its rich, even colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and fine-grained texture made it very valuable.
A pillar hewn from it, overrun by curly-tailed
dragons and roses of strange design, was
assigned to stand in a temple of the Flowery
Land. Another part was to misrepresent the
king in the market-place of a country town;
and they had accepted other orders as well, for
the whole mass weighed some thousands of
tons. Upon the fulfilment of these conditions
the future of the quarry depended. For three
weeks past they had been hard at work loosening
the granite from its bed and getting it free
from the other blocks which wedged it in:
an operation involving nice calculation and
accurate obedience. Under Charlesworth’s
directions, shot-holes three feet deep and six
inches apart were bored along the line of
cleavage, cleaned out, charged with a cartridge,
and filled up or tamped with clay. With each
cartridge a length of slow fuse was connected,
the different strands being gathered together
in a metal case called the igniter, so that the
cartridges could be fired simultaneously. Some
use electricity to explode the charge, Charlesworth
did not. The operator, generally himself,
had to betake himself nimbly out of the
way while the fuse burned on at three feet per
minute till it came to the cartridge and finished
its work. Already several small blasts had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
taken place, preparatory to the large final
explosion which was to dissever the whole block
from its bed.</p>

<p>“I guess <em>that’s</em> what they’ve got their eye
on,” said Charlesworth, coming to a stand in
front of the cliff.</p>

<p>Farquhar thrust his hands into his pockets
and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Dmitri Dmitriyevitch vows to be avenged
of his enemies,” suggested Lucian at his ear.</p>

<p>“What’s that?—Shut up, De Saumarez, I’m
doing a little thinking. So you think they
mean to spoil the stone, eh, Charlesworth?”</p>

<p>“I guess they mean to,” said the American,
austerely, “but I guess I don’t mean them to.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I guess the same; but how do
you think they’d set about it?”</p>

<p>“Tamper with the cartridges. Overcharge
them, I’d bet: smash the whole place up, so’s
you couldn’t cut a lady’s paper-weight out of
the bits. And if we went up along with it I
guess they wouldn’t go into mourning. That’s
the kind of crowd they are: measly little city-bred
slushes who’ll do anything so long as they
can keep their own skins whole.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to lose my granite, and still
less to lose my life,” said Farquhar. “How do
you propose to circumvent them?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s three of us, sir; I reckon we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
should be able to keep things straight. I dare
say you know the difference between a one-pound
charge and a two-pound, and I know I
do, and so does Mr. de Saumarez here. What
we shall have to do is to watch. There’s a
matter of a couple more blasts to run, besides
the last. It’ll mean testing every charge
every time; but that’s how I made out we’d
do it. Or, of course, if you like it better, we
could cave in, and give the little beggar his
solatium, and raise the men; that’d quiet them
for a bit, and then I dare say they’d let us get
this job through and we could fight it out after,
when we don’t stand to lose so much. I’m not
boss here; it’s for you to choose, sir.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, De Saumarez?”</p>

<p>“What the dickens is the use of me saying
anything, when you’ve already made up your
mind like unto the solid earth that cannot be
moved?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ll fight it out, then,” said
Farquhar, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Fight goes,” concluded Charlesworth.</p>

<p>And they went back to the hotel.</p>

<span class="fs80">SMALL BEER</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A white cloth, white lilies and scarlet
geraniums, red-tiled floor, flax-blue china:
the low sun of evening painted their colours
afresh; the lily petals glistened and sparkled
like frosty snow. All the windows were open,
and the soft little wind that stirred the straight
muslin curtains filled the empty room with the
scent of unseen pinks. Then came in Dolly,
carrying a squat rounded jug of brown earthenware
smoothly overlaid in silver; the spot of
light dancing inside showed that the jug was
full. She set it down by the wooden elbow-chair
at the table’s foot, put straight a sprig
of parsley on the dish of cold meat, glanced at
the clock, which said five minutes to seven, and
then sat down, half in sunshine and half in
shade, with her hands in her lap. For no
longer than a minute was she idle; a book lay
open on the table, its leaves ruffling and flying
over and over, and she pulled it across and
began to read at haphazard, as one visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
an old friend. For between those covers her
old friends dwelt in an army, and Dolly’s
favourite was named Jonis d’Artagnan. Since
the age of seven she had read Dumas in his
native tongue. Her brow was clear, her breath
was even, she only moved to turn her page;
tranquillity was Dolly’s dower, bestowed on her
by perfect health and peaceful nerves.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Bernard came in, and Dolly
quitted the oak of Fontainebleau to make the
tea. “Have you washed your hands?” was her
greeting, for Bernard was not as careful about
such things as he might have been. Bernard
answered: “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Had a good day?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair.”</p>

<p>Standing before the tray, Dolly put a piece
of sugar into her cup, then some milk, then
some cream, and, lastly, the clear, auburn,
aromatic tea. Authorities agree that this is
the only correct method of tea-making, but
Dolly kept their laws without knowing them.
Bernard tilted up the silver jug and looked
inside, and glanced across at his sister. “Have
you got another cup?” he inquired. “I guess
I’ll have tea to-night.”</p>

<p>“<em>Tea</em>, Bernard?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there enough to go round?”</p>

<p>“Oh! plenty,” said Dolly. “Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>“I’m off beer for the present; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite good; I tasted some when I drew
it,” said Dolly, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Dare say,” said Bernard, regarding the
silver jug as though he thought the beer very
good indeed, “but I don’t want it to-day. Are
you going to give me some tea?”</p>

<p>Dolly made a step towards the cupboard,
checked herself, and sat down. “You’d better
fetch the cup yourself; it’s the proper thing for
you to wait on me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we should always be on our
best behaviour here at home,” observed Bernard,
as, in complying, he knocked over the
sugar basin.</p>

<p>“Because if you don’t practise at home you
go wrong when you are out. You pushed past
me on Sunday as we came out of church.”</p>

<p>The charge being true, Bernard felt annoyed.
He essayed to drink his tea, pursed up his lips,
and put down the cup in a hurry.</p>

<p>“If you won’t drink the beer, I will; it would
be a pity to waste it,” said Dolly, who was
watching him.</p>

<p>“You’d get tipsy if you drank all that.”</p>

<p>“I was not proposing to drink all that; I
could not do it if I tried. I cannot understand
how men can dispose of so much.”</p>

<p>“Girls don’t work like men do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you are giving it up, then;
I’ve noticed that you were beginning to get
stout.”</p>

<p>Bernard continued to look stolid. Out of
patience, Dolly launched at him a sudden
question.</p>

<p>“Are you turning teetotaller to please Miss
Laurenson?”</p>

<p>“I’m not turning teetotaller. I’m only
trying it for a time.”</p>

<p>“But is it to please Miss Laurenson?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; I guess it is.”</p>

<p>“Not really, Bernard?” asked Dolly, with a
change of tone.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“She isn’t your sort. And you’ve only
known her for six weeks.”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I wouldn’t say the
dude is your sort; but you seem to like talking
to him.”</p>

<p>“Bernard, do you want to marry her?” asked
Dolly, after a pregnant pause.</p>

<p>“I’m going to.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it occurred to you that she may have
something to say about that?”</p>

<p>“I dare say she’ll refuse me, but if she does I
can ask her again.”</p>

<p>“And if she refuses you again?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go on asking till she accepts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>

<p>“In fact, if you persevere you think she is
bound to give in?”</p>

<p>“Girls generally do.”</p>

<p>“Do they? I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t like most girls. You’ve been
brought up with men.”</p>

<p>“But, Bernard, Miss Laurenson is an heiress;
she has eight hundred a year of her own,
and more to come. Mrs. Merton told me
so.”</p>

<p>“Has she? Well, eight hundred a year’ll
come in handy; I’m glad to hear it. If it’s true,
that is.”</p>

<p>“And she is very pretty, and she dresses well,
and her family is unexceptionable,” pursued
Dolly. “I expect she could marry a peer if
she liked, or at any rate a courtesy title.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but all those titled chaps are pretty
rotten,” said Bernard, cheerfully damning the
aristocracy in a lump. “She’d do a sight better
to take me. I’m pretty strong and free from
vice, and sound in wind and limb; and as for
family, I guess ours is good enough for anybody,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Dolly was reduced to silence, but she was so
completely preoccupied that she poured cream
and sugar into Bernard’s cup and filled it up
with beer, producing a mixture which he
denounced in emphatic language and emptied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
out of the window. Presently she interrupted
his talk about the farm by asking:</p>

<p>“Bernard, are you fond of her?”</p>

<p>“She’s getting a bit long in the tooth, it’s
true, but she’s a pretty creature still. I guess
she suits me as well as any,” was the surprising
answer.</p>

<p>“I mean Miss Laurenson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you were talking about old
Empress; I was.”</p>

<p>“Are you fond of her?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bernard, composedly. “I am.”</p>

<p>Dolly shrugged her shoulders. “I hope it
will turn out well.”</p>

<p>“Hope so, too,” said Bernard. “She ought
to take me simply out of gratitude. Anything
more beastly than tea with this cold
beef I never did taste!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the morrow, while Dolly was sweeping
her room out, Maggie came up, gasping, to
announce “Miss Lawson”; she had a happy
knack of confounding names. It was, in truth,
Angela, driven up by the pair of donkeys, as
Ella Merton said, though only one was in the
shafts. Mrs. Merton herself would not come
in, because, she declared, Jehoshaphat would
eat the reins if he were left. Jehoshaphat had
a satanic temper and was more completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
omnivorous than an ostrich; beside devouring
reins and boots and tin-tacks, he had a
craving for any human flesh except that of
his mistress, an exception which Ella triumphantly
adduced in support of her self-bestowed
name, since, said she, dog doesn’t
eat dog.</p>

<p>Therefore Angela was alone in the parlour
when Dolly came down; rather hot, in a faded
old dress: Angela, very cool and dainty in
white muslin, now feeling that the advantage
of appearance had fallen to her. Yet, in spite
of her dress and her daintiness, she was still
like a delicate sketch by the side of a beautiful
painting.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Mr. Fane isn’t in,” she began,
rather stiffly. Angela could not approve of
Dolly, and would not pretend that she did.</p>

<p>“The regret will be all on his side. Won’t
you sit down?” quoth Dolly, very polite.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t stay, I am keeping Mrs.
Merton. May I leave a message for him?”</p>

<p>“I shall be charmed to deliver it,” Dolly
assured her; and Angela sought consolation
by mentally dubbing her accent provincial.
Dolly exasperated her to such an extent that
she was ready to imagine a Kentish twang in
Miss Fane’s foreign intonation.</p>

<p>“I believe Mr. Fane is interested in temperance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
reform”—here Dolly smiled—“and I
thought under the circumstances he might care
to attend the great unsectarian conference which
is to be held at Swanborough next week. I
dare say you have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“No; we have severed our connection with
the chapel.”</p>

<p>“This meeting is undenominational.”</p>

<p>“Essence of chapel, isn’t that? Or so I
have always understood.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will tell your brother that it
begins at three o’clock,” Angela trusted herself
to say.</p>

<p>“I am sure Bernard will be delighted to go.
Of course, he might speak himself almost as a
reformed drunkard.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fane?”</p>

<p>“You converted him, did you not?”</p>

<p>“I converted him? From what?”</p>

<p>“Oh! from his habit of drinking beer. I am
so glad; I have often told him that he took
too much.”</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Fane?” said Angela, in accents
of serious concern. “I had no idea of it!
What a shocking thing! I am indeed thankful
that I have been instrumental in helping him to
reform.”</p>

<p>Dolly’s lips twitched, but she instantly
followed Angela’s lead. “Of course it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
yet very serious, and he did not often—well—exceed.
But I assure you I am most grateful
for all you have done; you have a wonderful
influence over him—truly wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall hope to see him at Swanborough;
and perhaps you will come, too? You
need not feel embarrassed; there will be plenty
of girls of your own age to keep you in countenance,”
said Angela, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” said Dolly, as she
opened the front door.</p>

<p>She stood on the step to speed the parting
guests. When the last flicker of Angela’s
white parasol had vanished, she remarked to
herself: “Certainly Bernard has a better right
to trust his own judgment than any one I
know!”</p>

<p>Both she and Bernard went to Swanborough
for the meeting. They drove; and, after putting
up the horse, had the satisfaction of encountering
Miss Laurenson and her brother
outside the station. Bernard went straight to
Angela’s side, and Dolly found herself walking
with Mr. Laurenson. Lal was no talker; and
as the uncivilized Dolly had not yet learned
to speak when she did not want to, they walked
on in silence.</p>

<p>Swanborough was a town of twenty thousand
people, mostly wicked. Standing on a tidal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
river, it harboured the vessels of all nations and
the peculiar vices of each; there were, besides,
barracks in the town, which brought their
special dangers. High wages and a high
standard of living prevailed: the head of one
family would be calling for green peas in April,
while the head of another, discharged from
the same position, perhaps for drunkenness,
would send his children, filthy, barefoot, and
famishing, into the street to beg. That popular
vice, drunkenness, flourished like a green bay-tree.
A public-house blossomed at every
street’s corner, and its devotees lounged in its
shade with their hands in their holey pockets.
Passing one such palace as a youth pushed open
the door, Dolly had a view of the crowded bar,
and breathed in a puff of hot vapour wherein
the scents of tobacco and gin and old clothes
contended for the mastery.</p>

<p>“There are too many of those places!” she
exclaimed, averting her offended face.</p>

<p>“There are,” Lal answered her, rather bitterly.</p>

<p>“I cannot see why the licenses are renewed.”</p>

<p>“Can you not? Every English government
lives by this traffic; do you expect pious sons
to commit parricide?”</p>

<p>“You feel very strongly about it,” said
Dolly, wondering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>“I see the results of the present system.”</p>

<p>“Then do you believe in Prohibition or in
Local Option?”</p>

<p>“I? I believe in putting the whole trade
under public control, in reducing the number
of licenses, and in giving the publicans a
fixed salary independent of the number of
men they turn into drunkards.”</p>

<p>“But those are not Miss Laurenson’s views,
surely?” asked Dolly, somewhat taken aback.
Lal was already repenting of his candour.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the questions of principle on
which we differ,” he said, in his soft, lazy voice.
“Don’t betray me, Miss Fane; it will be time
for me to reveal my heresies when Prohibition
comes down out of the clouds. Angela herself
is not where her theories are; she does plenty
of practical hard work.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurenson, what practical hard work
do you do?”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“You. I know you do something.”</p>

<p>“Who told you anything about me?”</p>

<p>“No one. I gathered it from the way you
speak.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.” Lal was unmistakably relieved.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me how you set about
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>

<p>“I’d rather not discuss the question.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Dolly. Twice,
now, had he shut up like an oyster and pinched
her fingers; and she was half angry, until she
recognised that he meant no rudeness. To
this conclusion was she brought by the study
of his face. Lal, when he spoke of himself, had
a trick of drooping his eyelids, so that, as the
lashes were long, his eyes were hidden completely;
he was foolish enough to be modest.
The compression of his sensitive lips notified
Dolly of another extenuating circumstance:
namely, that he was uncomfortable to the
point of frenzy. In escaping her inquiries he
was ready to leap clear over the bars of politeness;
surely, then, since he so valorously defended
their privacy, his convictions must be
very dear to him. As she was musing thus, the
drooped lids were raised with disconcerting
abruptness, and Lal’s beautiful dark-grey eyes
looked down appealingly.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to be rude. I would rather
be rude to any one than you,” he said.</p>

<p>Dolly’s breathing quickened; a warm spring
rose in her heart. “I had no business to ask
you; but I thought perhaps I might do something
myself,” she said.</p>

<p>“It is only that I—” Here Lal stopped. “I
don’t think—” he began again; and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
clothed his thought in a general law, altogether
eliminating the painful personal pronoun <em>I</em>.
“An amateur’s private opinion is never very
interesting.”</p>

<p>“And you would rather not talk about your
private opinions.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very good at it,” Lal admitted.
“In fact, I generally make a fool of myself
when I try—as on the present occasion.” The
victim of aphasia had put off his apology until
they were close to the hall, and further conversation
was stopped by their arrival at the
door.</p>

<p>“You’re coming in?” said Dolly, as he
paused.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you approve of <em>this</em>?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t like religion when it’s
vulgar,” said Lal. He raised his hat and
walked off down the street, and Dolly and her
friends went in.</p>

<p>No cause needs salvation from its friends
as does this of temperance. Intolerance, exaggeration,
bad logic, bad taste, and bad
grammar have all supported and do support it
still, estranging men who would be content to
work with the reformers if they took their
stand on the noble charter given them by St.
Paul: “<em>If meat make my brother to offend, I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
eat no flesh while the world standeth.</em>” At Swanborough
there were two evangelists, whose
names appeared on the programme as Rev.
Dr. Brown and Rev. S. Jones, for your true
temperance evangelist eschews the adjective
<em>the</em> as rigidly as temperance in his speeches.
The one spoke on “Gospel Dynamics”; the
other proved the Bible a total-abstinence book
and, incidentally, himself no orator. Angela
found it hard to feel pleased; she looked at
Bernard, and saw him yawning undisguisedly,
and then at Dolly, who sat with hands folded,
inattentive but composed.</p>

<p>And Dolly was composed, though she was
conscious of a strange exaltation which rosed
her cheek and set her heart throbbing and
pulses beating in time with it in every finger.
A well-spring of soft warmth suffused her
frame; she shut her eyes and saw visions, she
who was no dreamer—visions in which one
figure alone was constant. She owned the
truth. “I love him,” she told herself. Shame
she did not feel; she believed that Lal loved her
back, and even if he did not there was no humiliation,
since her gift was voluntary, since
she was proud of her love. He won her by
being better than herself. Dolly was a little
pagan; her love was wild as a bird; but in it ran
a puritan strain which claimed an answering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
purity in the man she loved. Irreproachable
though he was, Noel Farquhar could not give
her that, nor yet could Lucian, though he
was nearer to her ideal. But in Dolly’s room
at home she had an engraving of Watts’s fine
picture of Sir Galahad; and the artist might
have drawn his young knight’s face from Lal as
he looked on a Sunday morning in church,
when he sat in his corner behind a pillar
which hid him from sight, as he thought.
Had he known that Dolly had a clear though
narrow view of his profile against the black
marble of a mural tablet, it would have made
him retrospectively very unhappy.</p>

<p>Love left Dolly the same girl as before, save
that it illumined a side of her nature which
had been hidden, as the sunlight, creeping
across from the first faint rim of the crescent,
slowly enlightens the disk of the moon. True,
she now felt quite charitable towards Angela;
but Angela was Lal’s sister. She was also
more lenient to the ungrammatical orators on
the platform; for the excellent reason that she
did not listen to them. These were accidents
of circumstance. But when a stout lady in
front ecstatically planted the hind-leg of her
chair upon Dolly’s instep and sat heavily
down, the ennobling power of love did not
hold her back from feeling annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>When they came out Dolly listened to a
discussion of the meeting, and herself added
her word with moderate indifference. They
walked together to the station, but Dolly,
whose mood was dreamy, soft, and languorous,
dissociated herself from the others and walked
alone. As she passed the Sailors’ Arms, which
seemed a popular hostelry, the door again
stood open, and again Dolly glanced in, and
again saw the crowded bar; but this time Sir
Galahad was leaning across the counter conversing
with the bar-maid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV<br><br>
<span class="fs80">COLLOQUIES WITH AN OUTSIDER</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Dolly did her best to get Bernard away
from the station before Lal came up; but
as she had only that morning been preaching
the duties of man to unprotected females, and
as Bernard’s desires went wholly along with
his duty, she could not detach him from
Angela. She went away herself, on the pretext
of ordering the dog-cart, met Lal in the station
yard, looked full in his face, and refused to
know him.</p>

<p>Angela was waiting impatiently; Lal had
promised to meet her at six o’clock, their
train went at six-fifteen, and it was now five
minutes past. Lal was always exact in keeping
his engagements. Angela felt uneasy, and
was cross. Bernard stayed with her till ten
minutes after the hour, and then hurried off
to consult his sister. Dolly was quite ready to
drive back alone; perhaps because the route
through Hungrygut Bottom was in her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
as the best way home, and to it Bernard might
have demurred on the horse’s account, for
it was steep and stony, the roads having been
recently repaired. She had an idea that Lal
might be waiting in the high-road to see her
pass. Bernard, having her consent, hurried
back; he was just in time to install Angela in a
first-class carriage, with himself as guardian
for their half-hour’s journey. Then Angela,
discovering that she was shut up alone with
Bernard Fane, began to wish herself idiotic,
dead, buried, anywhere out of the world, and
plunged into a fresh discussion of temperance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lal had stood like a statue till Dolly was out
of sight, and then tried to follow her. He had
not seen which road she took, and his wanderings
led him far from the station. At last he
bethought him that the horse must be stabled
somewhere, and began to inquire; and half
an hour later tracked her down at the Railway
Hotel. While he was still questioning the
waiter, a man passed through the hall and
would have gone out had not Lal interrupted
himself and sprang forward, crying out,
“Meryon!”</p>

<p>The gambler turned round, colouring with
pleasure. “I didn’t know you were home!”
he said. “I heard you’d got no end of stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and orders, but I didn’t know you were home!
I’m so awfully glad.”</p>

<p>“I’m staying with the Mertons; what are you
doing?”</p>

<p>“I’m here for the night. Come to my room,
will you? There’s heaps I want to know.”</p>

<p>Lal, who had just heard that Dolly had
departed full half an hour ago, abandoned his
quest for the nonce, and went. Meryon and
he had been friends for years, though the
guardian angel knew it not; she would have
feared the effect of pitch on Lal’s innocence
if she had. They met rarely; in the intervals
their friendship hibernated, coming out unspoiled
when times of refreshing arrived. Meryon
wrote never, Lal rarely, and when he did
his stiff little letters were mere catalogues of
events. But friendship, like the python, can
live for years unfed.</p>

<p>Meryon’s room was full of untidy properties
tidily arranged. A discreditable old Collard
&amp; Collard was its only luxury. He had been
playing patience, and the cards were scattered
about the table; Lal sat down on a bedroom
chair, leaning his elbow on the wash-stand and
his chin on his hand, and watched Meryon
gather them up.</p>

<p>“You haven’t given up playing, then?” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>“No, I never shall now—the cards have got
their grip on me. You’re looking sick, Lal,”
said the elder man, earnestly; “what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“I got hurt, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I heard about that in the papers.
You came back in a regular blaze of glory; I
was awfully proud of knowing you. Is your
sister all right?”</p>

<p>“Angela? Perfectly—about to marry, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“Is the man a good sort?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very. I think she will be happy.”</p>

<p>“Been doing any more of your own work?”</p>

<p>“At intervals. When the chance comes.”</p>

<p>Meryon jerked the bottom of the pack down
on the table, and pressed and patted it straight
between his palms. “Try a game of écarté?”
he suggested.</p>

<p>Lal shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’ll play without stakes, for once.”</p>

<p>“No. I never play.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not. Even father used to
play whist in the evenings, he and mother and
two of the canons, awfully decent old chaps;
and I used to stand behind mother and give
her tips. Father was no end of a good player.
I don’t see why you won’t, Lal. It’s wonderful
how it takes you out of yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>Lal shook his head again. “I never have
played and never shall.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>Meryon looked at him earnestly. “You’re
very queer, Lal,” he said. “I believe you’ve
got heaps of things in you that no one ever
suspects. I believe you’re a born gambler—I
hope you won’t mind my saying so. But
there’s no harm; you aren’t like me, you’d
never give way to it.”</p>

<p>“If I once began I should never stop,” Lal
took him up, swiftly. “You’re right; I’m not
like you, Meryon. I haven’t your pluck. I
had to give up motoring because I could not
keep my head while I was driving. I’m as
weak as water.”</p>

<p>“But you never do the things, you only
want to and don’t let yourself. I call that being
strong, not weak. That’s just what I like.
You’re so excitable, you have to keep tight
hold of yourself for fear you should go to the
bad, and yet you never do anything you
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Lal only shrugged his shoulders. Meryon,
who was still standing, dropped the cards and
put his hand on Lal’s arm. “What <em>is</em> the
matter?” he said, tenderly. “What’s worrying
you, old fellow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>Lal did not answer, because he was incapable
of explaining. It was necessary for his interlocutor
to drag the truth out of him by questions.
Dolly had found out this; but whereas
Lal’s desire had been to escape from her, he
was anxious to make confession to Meryon.</p>

<p>“I say, old fellow, is it a girl?” questioned
the gambler.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, it’s serious; it would be with
you. Won’t she have you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t asked her.”</p>

<p>“Have you had a quarrel?”</p>

<p>“I have just met her, and she cut me dead.
Heaven knows why; I don’t.”</p>

<p>Meryon, by a string of questions, contrived
to elicit the story of Lal’s courtship. The
cause of Dolly’s coldness puzzled him, as it
had puzzled Lal, but after several abortive inquiries
he hit at last on the right track.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what could have happened
while the meeting was going on to make her
change so. What were you doing all the
time?”</p>

<p>“Business.”</p>

<p>“What, your own sort of business?”</p>

<p>Lal nodded.</p>

<p>“Whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me where, old fellow—that is, if you
don’t mind me meddling.”</p>

<p>“At the Sailors’ Arms; you know the place.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hell of a hole,” said Meryon, soberly.
“Did you go in?”</p>

<p>“For a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“I say, it’s on the way from the Corn Exchange
to the station. I say, do you think
she could have seen you?”</p>

<p>Lal was silent. Remembering that Dolly had
noticed the place before, he thought it possible.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well to say girls don’t mind
that sort of thing—like a man to sow his wild
oats, and all that; but they do mind, the nicest
of them. And she’d think you must be such
an awful humbug, too. You know, old fellow,
the thing for you to do is to go and ask her,
and tell her right away.”</p>

<p>“I could not possibly do it, and I would not
for the world if I could,” said Lal, with great
decision.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>Lal shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I expect you mean you’re too shy, and
don’t like talking about that sort of thing
to a girl. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Old fellow, can’t you get over that?”</p>

<p>“I <em>cannot</em>,” said Lal, impatiently. “What,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
tell Miss Fane that I—that the girl—Besides,
she doesn’t care a straw for me. I shall
ask her if she’ll have me, and then go. Angela,
at least, will be heartily glad.”</p>

<p>“Is her name Fane? Not Dolly Fane, by
any chance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“I took her in to dinner once at the Mertons,”
said Meryon. After a pause he went on:
“Do you know, Lal, there’s two other men
after her. De Saumarez, who I’ve told you
about, is one, and Farquhar, the M.P.”</p>

<p>“Of course she likes one of them,” said Lal,
after another pause. “I hope it isn’t Farquhar.
I dislike that fellow.”</p>

<p>“I thought he was all that’s virtuous.
You never caught him out in any tricks, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Not I! But I’d rather she married a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I always thought he was an awful swell,”
said Meryon, meekly.</p>

<p>Lal coloured and laughed, and glanced up
through his eyelashes. “I am a conceited,
dogmatic prig; how can you possibly tolerate
me, Meryon?” he said. “I’ve talked about
myself long enough; now let’s hear what
you’ve been doing.”</p>

<p>They talked on for an hour or more, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
then Meryon persuaded Lal to play to him,
listening the while in quiet, uncritical enjoyment,
and caressing the black kitten asleep
on his knee. Meryon always stipulated for a
piano in his room when his resources could be
stretched to cover such a luxury. He was
very fond of strumming out airs from the
overtures and selections which he heard from
bands at casinos; he had an ear for melody,
but had never learned music. Lal, on the
contrary, was a practised pianist; he played
correctly, an achievement rare in these days;
his execution was sure and delicate, his touch
very clear, bright, and firm. He was very
careful to hide this talent of his in a napkin.
Meryon had come to hear of it by accident.
Lal sat down and very quietly played through
first a sonata by Mozart, then a <i lang="fr">courante</i> of
Bach’s. His taste was for the orderly, old-fashioned
music; he hated Wagner, and thought
even Mendelssohn too fond of innovations.
Did not he say of himself that he was dogmatic?
But he gave Meryon great pleasure.</p>

<p>Later, Lal went home; and Meryon, after
seeing him off by one train, waited on the
platform and himself followed by the next.
From Monkswell station he walked to Fanes,
but Dolly had not yet come in, nor had Bernard.
Meryon would not wait; he strolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
up the Swanborough road in the hope of meeting
her. Nor was he disappointed. A mile
up the road he saw a girl leading a horse down
the hill, and by her supple, slim young figure
and the brightness of her hair he recognised
Miss Fane. The steepness of Hungrygut Bottom
plus the violent snortings of a steam-roller
had again proved too much for the
nerves of the chestnut; he bolted down the
hill and almost kicked the cart to pieces before
Dolly, who had jumped out, could catch and
quell him. She left the dog-cart for repair at
Dove Green, the next village, and led Vronsky
home. Her dark cloth dress had a long skirt,
which she held up gracefully, like a French
girl, with curved wrist and prettily bent hand.
She came on, looking straight before her;
her lips were hard and her face was hard;
no melting mood was hers. Irony, and a
stiff-necked refusal to bend before the blast
were Dolly’s armour against trouble; she was
bitterly humiliated, and would not cede an
inch to humiliation. Certain constricting bands
seemed to have closed round her heart; she
had not spent so long a day since she was
seven and waited outside her mother’s room
for the news of her death.</p>

<p>“Let me lead the horse, won’t you?” said
Meryon, turning to walk with her. Meryon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
was polite by instinct, as Dolly was graceful.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no; he bites.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you got smashed up. I hope
you weren’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, thank you.”</p>

<p>This was unpromising. Meryon despaired of
introducing his subject tactfully; he was not,
therefore, discouraged, but plunged straight
into it.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been seeing Lal Laurenson,” he
said. “I beg your pardon, I hope you won’t
think it awful cheek of me to shove my oar in,
but I can’t help it. I’ve been friends with
Laurenson ever since we were at Eton together.
He’s been so awfully good to me, I can’t help
speaking now. You cut him in Swanborough
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to tell you. I mean,” said
Dolly, “I don’t want to be rude, but I can’t
explain my reason. I had one.”</p>

<p>“Was it because you saw him in at the
Sailors’ Arms?”</p>

<p>Dolly hesitated for a minute; then she
answered: “Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad—I thought that was it.
I can explain why he was there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<p>“Wait,” said Dolly. “Who told you this?”</p>

<p>“I got it out of Laurenson. I met him at the
Railway Hotel, where he was asking for you.”</p>

<p>“Does he know you have come to me?”</p>

<p>“Him? Rather not; I came right away
without telling; he wouldn’t have let me if
he’d known. He said he’d never explain,
himself, and he wouldn’t; he can’t bear talking
about it.”</p>

<p>“I can believe it.”</p>

<p>“No, really you’re quite wrong, you are
indeed, Miss Fane. Laurenson isn’t like that.
He went there after a girl. She had run away
from her home and he wanted her to go back.
He goes in for that kind of thing. He and
Miss Laurenson have got a Home in London
which they run out of their own money, but
it’s Lal that has to do with working it; he’s
better than a parson, for he doesn’t ever preach,
he just lives. If he’d been anywhere in
Europe that time I had to break my promise,
I’d never have given way as I did and become
the beast I am. He’d have seen me through.
He respects you, and you simply can’t help
being what he thinks. He never told me
about that Home, I just found it out. I’ve been
over it with him. I never shall forget it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the name of the girl he saw at
the Sailors’ Arms?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span></p>

<p>“Hilda Davis. She comes from here.”</p>

<p>“I see. Thank you,” said Dolly. “Yes;
I am glad to know.”</p>

<p>Meryon stopped. “I’m glad you don’t think
it was cheek of me. I’d better go back now;
I’ll just catch my train.”</p>

<p>“Did you come here simply to tell me this?”
said Dolly. “You’re a good friend.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t anything in it. I didn’t think
you’d snub me; and if you had I’d have been
bound to tell you just the same. Laurenson’s
been no end good, being friends with an outsider
like me,” said Meryon, with simplicity.</p>

<p>Poor outsider! From a great way off his
tired eyes had seen the bright circle of happiness;
he came to the light, passed through it,
and so out into the cold and lonely twilight,
where his own lot was cast. He was made for
the life of a home: sociable, contented, affectionate,
fond of quiet pleasures, a lover of little
children. But the tyrannous demon who had
ruled him would grant no peace; Meryon was
driven out into the wilderness, where he lived
and where he died.</p>

<span class="fs80">A NIGHT-PIECE</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">It might have been supposed that Dolly
would be anxious to make amends for
her injustice. When Bernard came in, saying
that Mrs. Merton had invited them both to
dinner the next day but one, and that he had
accepted her kindness, she should have been
pleased; in place of which she declared that
she could not go. She had no dress, she said.
Bernard pointed out that she had dined with
the Mertons before. “Oh yes,” said Dolly;
“but one can’t wear the same thing twice over,”
and she stood upon her argument till Bernard
calmly told her that he should go and she
could stay. Dolly came near to a quarrel
with him; she did actually provoke one with
her father; and then she went to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning she awoke reasonable and
sweeter-tempered, and begged her father’s
pardon in words, and Bernard’s in deeds by
making hot cakes for breakfast. Peace reigned
over the house of Fanes, except in Dolly’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
mind, which was still disturbed. For yesterday,
in the flush of her indignation and
reasonable anger, she had taken a step that she
could not retrace. Waiting under the white
sign-post at Dove Green for the smith’s report
on her shattered dog-cart, Dolly had
made up her mind upon one point, and had
clinched the matter at once in the post-office
adjoining the smithy; and now the contemplation
of the consequences filled her with
lively discomfort. She calculated that these
consequences could not arrive for two days, or
possibly three; she had two days to prepare;
but how she was to do so presented a problem of
weight. Dolly felt that she had made a fool
of herself, a sensation disagreeable to a girl so
proud as she; of all troubles she could least
stomach humiliation. Then, also, she knew
that her blunder would bring distress on
Lucian, and was heartily sorry, for she loved
him dearly. But there was another, darker
thought which would stay in her mind, despite
of reason and despite of resolution. Dolly had
felt the merciless power of Farquhar’s strength;
she feared his jealousy, cruel as the grave.
Vainly she told herself that he was Lucian’s
friend; he was her lover, but that had not
shielded her. Imagination offered lurid pictures
of a battle to the death between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
rivals. Vague ideas of sending Bernard out
to Petit-Fays as peace-maker crossed her mind,
but the irrepressible voice of common-sense
pointed out that her brother’s attitude towards
Noel Farquhar was not usually conciliatory;
also that, even if she sent him at once, he
could not possibly get there in time to do any
good. In view of this last consideration, Dolly
let the matter drop; but her mind was ill at
ease.</p>

<p>Next evening when Bernard came down into
the hall he found her waiting, muffled in a big
white shawl. Bernard’s hands and head were
too fully occupied with his white kid gloves
to allow him to draw deductions, and he discerned
nothing until she walked out in front of
him; then he said:</p>

<p>“Thought you weren’t coming?”</p>

<p>“I’ve changed my mind.”</p>

<p>Z-z-p, a button jumped off. “Oh, dash the
thing!” said Bernard, disgusted.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said Dolly, taking his wrist.
“What a pity it is your hands are so large.
Mine are at least small, though I’ve spoiled
the skin with hard work. What did you talk
about in the train yesterday?”</p>

<p>“That temperance rot, most of the time.”</p>

<p>“You do waste your chances, Bernard.”</p>

<p>“Well, she seemed to like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span></p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask her to marry you?
You mean to, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“All in good time; I’m in no such mighty
hurry.”</p>

<p>“I know <em>I</em> wouldn’t take you,” said Dolly,
viciously linking the final button.</p>

<p>“I guess I shouldn’t be such a fool as to
ask you,” responded her brother. “As it
happens, I mean to get an answer out of her
to-night.”</p>

<p>Dolly was silent. His name was the first
word that rose to her lips: his Christian name,
the usual preface of an appeal.</p>

<p>“Bernard.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Bernard, Angela Laurenson isn’t like me.
You ought to be careful; it’s easy to hurt her
feelings.”</p>

<p>“I know all about that.”</p>

<p>“<em>Do</em> you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bernard. “I do. I’m not an
idiot.”</p>

<p>Trying to draw sentimental confessions from
Bernard was like trying to pull a worm out of
its hole by the tail. Dolly felt that he was
slipping away, and put one last question.</p>

<p>“You do really care for her, Bernard?”</p>

<p>He deliberated for a minute; a most literal
truthfulness informed all Bernard’s assertions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t jump down into the lions
after her glove, like that chap in what’s-his-name,”
he said at last: “because I call that
silly. But if it was a question of her or me—I
guess I’d give my life for hers. I’m not quite
a fool, Dolly; I can manage for myself. I say,
do you think I ought to keep on these beastly
gloves at dinner? If they have birds or things
of that kind, they’ll split down the back.”</p>

<p>Bernard had not been quite open with his
sister. At that very moment Miss Laurenson
was sitting in her room with her face in her
hands and an outspread letter before her.
She had received it in the afternoon, and thus
it ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Laurenson</span>,—You showed yesterday
that you did not want me to speak, so I am not going
to bother you with a tête-à-tête. I am writing
this instead, to tell you that Fanes brings in about
three-fifty a year net, and in the past five years I have
saved over a thousand out of this, which invested in
Guaranteed Egyptians at four per cent. brings it up to
four hundred. I also expect the value of the property
to go up. My age is twenty-eight, and I am in
sound health. I have a fairly good temper. I have
not done anything that I should be ashamed of you
seeing, barring getting tipsy half a dozen times before I
was twenty, and carting manure. I used to poach on
Merton’s land one time, but only when I thought he
sold the game. I never have thought about any
other girl but you. Will you, if you think you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
take me, just put some white roses in your dress to-night?
If you wear red ones, I shall take it to mean
No. I hope very much you won’t wear red ones. I
am sorry I can’t send you any flowers, but our roses
were all blighted this year, and anyway I know Merton
has plenty in his garden.</p>

<p class="center">
“Ever yours with devotion,<br>
</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Bernard de Beaufort Fane</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Having laughed over this letter till she
cried, Angela was now almost ready to cry in
good earnest. After great searchings of heart
she had come to admit that Bernard was all the
world to her; but she would much have preferred
to renounce the world and remain her
maiden self. Angela was a little ascetic.
Though she loved him truly, it cost her a
bitter struggle to admit a man into her life;
especially a man such as Bernard, who would
gently brush away all her delicate scruples and
cobwebs of privacy, and take possession of her,
body and soul. She could trust him to be
gentle, but would he understand? To Angela,
wifehood seemed a strange and terrible thing.
She feared it—she feared its prelude of betrothal:
seeing herself more clearly than at
other times, she confessed that hers was the
nature for obeying, Bernard’s for ruling. And
how she should fare if her lover turned tyrant?</p>

<p>“I’ve brought your flowers,” Lal said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
coming in with a cluster of white roses and
ferns. They were prettily arranged, though a
little stiff. But Angela looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care for them? I thought they
went well with your dress.”</p>

<p>“I do like them; but—” Angela pushed over
Bernard’s letter and looked away. Lal smiled
as he read it.</p>

<p>“Well, and aren’t you going to wear them?”</p>

<p>“Shall I?”</p>

<p>“Are you in doubt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Lal.”</p>

<p>“Is it that you don’t care—?”</p>

<p>Angela shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then you must wear them,” Lal said. He
came to her and fastened them. Angela looked
down at the roses and up at his face; suddenly
she threw her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>“I’m a humbug, Lal,” she said. “You
always ruled, not I.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And he will. And I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Lal held her quietly. Presently he said: “I
think you’re mistaken, Angel.”</p>

<p>“<em>Do</em> you?” Angela said, looking up with
tears on her lashes. “Do you really, Lal?”</p>

<p>“I do. Fane isn’t exactly an ogre, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
know.” Lal smiled. “I shall be quite ready
to give you away to him.”</p>

<p>“And glad, too, I expect: ungrateful boy
that you are!” Angela released herself, and
began with unsteady fingers to pull out her
crushed curls. “Wait till you’re married yourself,
and see how you like it!”</p>

<p>“I see no immediate prospect of that,” said
Lal. “And now, does it not occur to you that
we might go down to dinner?”</p>

<p>Angela slipped her hand through his arm,
and so they descended the stairs. They made
a handsome couple, though Lal looked quieter
and lazier even than was his wont. On the
last step, Angela came to a pause of dismay;
she coloured crimson, snatched her hand from
Lal’s arm, and fled into the drawing-room. Lal
hesitated; he also changed colour; finally, he
made a very formal little bow, and followed his
sister without speaking. Dolly and Bernard
had just been admitted to the hall.</p>

<p>“I guess that chap’s gone cracked!” said
Bernard, sotto voce. But Dolly held her
peace.</p>

<p>There were present at the dinner only the
house party, the Laurensons and Mrs. Prideaux,
besides Dr. Maude, whose faint, acidulated
cynicism, said Ella Merton, was like a sauce
piquante. The voice of justice told Dolly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
she must let Lal know he was out of disgrace,
but it did not say that she was bound to explain
herself; and so, after smiling at him and taking
his hand when they met in the drawing-room,
she eschewed his society like the very plague.
She set herself to behave nicely; she said little,
and that little discreetly, and kept under the
wing of her hostess. She was amused to see
that Angela Laurenson was pursuing the same
tactics, except that she had chosen Maud
Prideaux for her house of defence.</p>

<p>Dolly went down with Norman Merton, and
found herself placed at table between him and
Lal. She gave Lal the view of a neck as white
as milk, and a rich sweep of chestnut hair
glossed with light like the roll of a stream at a
weir; and she talked to her host all the evening.
Merton was shrewd and pleasant, and had
plenty to say. Twice Lal addressed her: to
his first speech she gave a brief, cool answer
over her shoulder; to the second she gave no
answer at all. Lal did not repeat his words, nor
did he again try to catch her attention. He
turned quietly to his partner; he could afford
to be patient because he was resolute.</p>

<p>Bernard also was content to be patient, but
within reasonable limits, which he felt that
Angela had overpassed; she wore his roses, but
she had not given him a word that evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
His partner at dinner was Maud Prideaux;
and, following that simple strategy which goes
by the name of cheek, he took her into his
confidence and besought her help. Maud was
already pledged to Angela, but that did not
hinder her from deserting to Bernard’s side.
She was a born match-maker. As soon as the
men came up after dinner she proposed a
moonlight excursion to see the lake. Mrs.
Merton sighed forth a rapturous assent, sent
her husband for cloaks, and apostrophised the
stars in an impromptu verse. A French window
led out to a balcony, from which steps ran
down to the garden. Mrs. Merton went first,
to show the way; Angela, whose eyes were
quite blind in the dusk, was a few steps behind.
Maud Prideaux shot Bernard a mischievous
glance of invitation, stooped down,
and carefully tied up a bow which had not
come undone. In an instant Angela found her
chaperon’s place usurped by a tall figure, which
bent down and said, in a moving whisper:</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better take my arm or you’ll
tumble down the steps.”</p>

<p>This time Angela did not refuse; she laid her
fingers on his sleeve with a queer, wild thrill of
feeling, half pleasure and half fear. Bernard
put his own hand over hers. “I’m no end
glad,” he said, quite simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>Then he led her, trusting to his guidance for
every step, down a lonely, mossy path through
a copse of trees: to Bernard’s eyes the darkness
was clear as daylight. When they were as
far from the moonlit lake as the size of the
garden would permit, he began to talk.</p>

<p>“I expect you’re pretty shy of taking me,
aren’t you?” he said, gently.</p>

<p>“Rather. I—I should be—always—whoever
it was.”</p>

<p>“I suppose girls are made like that.”
Bernard paused to contemplate the strangeness
of feminine nature. “But what I mean is
that you feel it’s specially risky taking me,
because you and I are so different. Don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Angela said nothing.</p>

<p>“Dolly was trying to lecture me about that
this evening,” Bernard pursued. “She was
saying you aren’t like her. Well, I should
think anybody could see that who wasn’t an
ass. Dolly could walk twenty miles and come
up smiling, and I shouldn’t let you do more than
about two. And it’s just the same with your
feelings. You want looking after, and taking
care of, and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m used to taking care of myself, and Lal,
too,” Angela pointed out.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, you won’t do that any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
more,” Bernard assured her, with calm authority.
“Laurenson’ll have to shift for himself,
he’s old enough; and I shall look after you.
When we’re married, you know, I sha’n’t let
you do the dairy work or any of the things
Dolly does. We shall have to have another
servant; but that won’t matter so much, as
you’ve got some money of your own.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I have money of my
own?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Merton told Dolly you’d got eight
hundred a year. Of course, one can’t put
much faith in what she says, but there’s no
smoke without a fire; so I guessed you had
some. You have, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Merton never exaggerates. I have
what she said I had.”</p>

<p>“Have you really eight hundred a year?
It’ll come in handy at Fanes.”</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t ask me for my money,”
Angela said, with a forlorn laugh.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be such a fool.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be comfortable than rich, any
day. I wouldn’t saddle myself with a girl I
didn’t like, not if she had ten thousand a year.
I can’t stand rows. I suppose if it got too
bad you could arrange a separation, but I’d
sooner lose the money than have the bother of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
that. A man should keep his private affairs
out of people’s mouths.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you don’t think I shall make
rows,” said Angela. “But why did you want
me, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know.” Bernard paused and
meditated. “It wasn’t because of your money,
nor yet because you were pretty; I know that.
I only know, when I saw you that night, I felt
like the chap in Tennyson. You know; he saw
the girl at home in her oldest dress, looking
no end shabby, and he just said to himself:
<em>Here, by God’s rood, is the one maid for me.</em>
Well, I said the same; I made up my mind I’d
have you, right away.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I’d refused you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you would, in the long-run.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean exactly that,” Bernard
hastily added, feeling that he had not put the
case quite prettily. “I mean that I had a
kind of idea all along that you liked me,
just as I liked you, directly we met.”</p>

<p>Under the leaves and the soft summer stars
they paced the path together. It was so
dark that Angela bent her head to avoid an
empty shadow, and walked straight into the
brush of soft leaves which an elm-tree drooped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
across the way. She stood still while Bernard
freed her hair: expeditiously he did it, with no
tender dallyings, and she was truly thankful.
Angela was beginning to see what life would
be to Bernard Fane’s wife. Stable as the
English soil beneath their feet, temperate as
this English summer night, with no tropic
storms and no yawning earthquakes, so would
his love be; the cupboards in his house held no
skeletons. All Angela’s adventurous thoughts
of freedom were coming home to shelter under
a man’s protecting care. It was true that
Bernard had developed a talent for saying
what should not be said; but that Angela
resentfully ascribed to Dolly’s interference.
She saw herself darning her stalwart protector’s
socks by the fireside. The picture was touching
and beautiful. Yet—</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll like Fanes,” Bernard said,
tucking her hand comfortably under his arm.
“It’s all right now, but it’s a bit lonely in
winter.”</p>

<p>“We might spend the winter in London.”</p>

<p>“There’s no one but me to see to things; I
couldn’t get away.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have a manager?”</p>

<p>“Managers aren’t to be trusted. If you
want a thing well done, I guess you must do
it yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p>“But do you propose to stay at Fanes all
the year round?”</p>

<p>“No. You’ll want some sort of a holiday,
of course. I dare say I could get away for a
fortnight or so in January; things are pretty
slack then.”</p>

<p>Angela was silent for a space; then she said,
with some firmness: “I’m afraid I shall have
to be a good deal away, then; I must be in
London sometimes to attend meetings and
look after the different societies in which I am
interested. I shall ask Mrs. Prideaux to put
me up; that is pleasanter than going to a
hotel.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, you go up without me?”</p>

<p>“As you can’t get away, I suppose I must.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like that at all.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s jolly bad for husband and wife not to
be together. A woman’s place is with her
husband. Besides, people are safe to talk, and
that’s a thing I can’t stand. I guess I’ll have
to come up with you when you’re obliged to
go. I dare say you’ll chuck a good many of
the things after we’re married; girls generally
do.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you trust me in London alone?”
Angela said, in a very quiet voice.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t—” Bernard was beginning, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
all innocence, wishing to point out to Angela
the perils of the London streets, where she had
lived all her life, when she suddenly amazed
him by withdrawing her hand very decidedly,
and facing him in an unmistakably belligerent
attitude.</p>

<p>“In that case, Mr. Fane,” she said, her voice
trembling with indignation, “I think we had
better part at once.”</p>

<p>“Why, Angela!”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me that, please. There are
your flowers.” She cast the roses at his feet
with a dramatic gesture. “Your idea of a
wife seems to be a—a kind of carpet for you to
walk on. You don’t know why you wanted
to marry me; I’m sure I don’t know, either,
since you say it was not for my money. You
evidently don’t think I’m good for anything
useful, and you’ve told me that I’m not ornamental.
I’m not fit to do any of the things
Dolly does; I’m not to walk two miles without
your permission; I’m not to be trusted to go
about in London at all, and you even expect
me to give up the work I’ve been doing for
years, and <em>can</em> do! Thank you, Mr. Fane, the
prospect is not sufficiently attractive. I must
trouble you to look for a wife who is willing
to fall in with your peculiar tastes. <em>I’m</em>
not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>She turned her back and swept away, leaving
Bernard staring. He ran after her and caught
her up.</p>

<p>“Look here, Angela—”</p>

<p>“Let me alone at once!”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand—”</p>

<p>“I understand quite enough. <em>You</em> don’t
understand how to behave.”</p>

<p>“Angela, I do love you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t love you, and I don’t want to!”</p>

<p>She broke away, and he let her go. For five
minutes he stood quite still. Bernard had no
lack of wits, and he now saw his mistakes quite
plainly, the very mistakes against which Dolly
had tried to warn him. It was the bitterest
blow he had ever had in his life, and the
minutes he spent there alone were primed with
salutary reflections.</p>

<p>Angela, running out of the wood, came upon
Maud Prideaux, who was enjoying a moonlight
flirtation with Norman Merton.</p>

<p>“My dear child!”</p>

<p>“I—beg your pardon,” said Angela, breathless
and confused. Maud gave her a sharp
look. She turned on her companion. “Mr.
Merton, you can run away now and play;
I’m going to talk to Angela. Mind, the bet
stands.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mrs. Prideaux,” Merton answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
laughing as he went away. Maud scanned
Angela’s discomposed countenance with a
sparkling eye.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing?” she asked, in
her usual drawl.</p>

<p>Angela did not reply.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! Refusing Bernard Fane, upon
my honour! Really, Angela, it’s too bad to
lead the poor man on as you did and then
throw him over.”</p>

<p>“I did <em>not</em> lead him on.”</p>

<p>Maud shrugged her shoulders. “You’re a
shocking little flirt, my dear, but I really think
you might have let the poor barbarian go. I
shouldn’t wonder if the gardener swept him up
to-morrow, with his throat cut. There’s poor
Lal, too, ready to shoot himself. The way
you young people behave is quite dreadful; I
should have been ashamed to do so.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Prideaux before her marriage had
been the most open and shameless flirt, Angela
could not but resent this remark. “I <em>never</em>
flirted with Mr. Fane,” she said.</p>

<p>“How about his roses? I see you’ve given
them back to him.”</p>

<p>This was purely a guess, based on an observation
of glances during dinner and the absence
of the flowers from Angela’s corsage. Miss
Laurenson grew warmly red, and said nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Maud’s kindly inquisitive eyes searched her;
she tapped her on the shoulder with her fan.
“Come, tell me all about it. My dear child,
what have you been doing? You’re like Lot’s
wife, all tears.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’m not salt yet,” said Angela,
whose eyes were still quite dry.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it Lot’s wife? I don’t pretend to
be clever; it wasn’t the fashion for girls to know
anything in my day. What have you been
saying to Bernard Fane?”</p>

<p>Sure of an interested listener, Angela told
her tale. At its close she got a surprising
shock. “Do you know what you ought to do
now?” said Mrs. Prideaux.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Go right back and beg his pardon.”</p>

<p>“Maud! I’d rather die!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and to-morrow you’ll be dying—dying
to go and do it, but it’ll be too late then.
You’re simply desperately in love with him,
can’t say his name without blushing—yes,
there she goes, the colour of a poppy! The
child says she’s not in love with him! Well,
well!”</p>

<p>“I hate him!” Angela declared, hiding her
crimson cheeks in her hands.</p>

<p>“My dear child, hatred’s the back door into
love. Think of him, lying on the damp ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
with his throat cut!—such a nice throat, too!
He’s adorably handsome, for a barbarian. Of
course, he drops an h or so now and then—”</p>

<p>“He never does.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he? Well, no doubt you know
better than I do. I wouldn’t have your
conscience, Angela.”</p>

<p>“He was very rude to me.”</p>

<p>“Asked you to marry him, didn’t he?
Shockin’ presumption!”</p>

<p>“I only told him the truth.”</p>

<p>“When I refused a man, I always did it
nicely and tried to spare his feelings. I don’t
see why you are so angry with the poor man;
I’m sure it was very brave of him to fall in
love with you.”</p>

<p>Silence for a little while. Angela said at
last: “Maud, do you really think I ought to
beg his pardon?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the slightest doubt of it, my dear.”</p>

<p>“It will look as though I wanted—”</p>

<p>“Exactly what you do want. You’ve been
talking a great deal about the rights of women
all your life; haven’t you found out yet that a
woman’s best right is to obey her husband?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, and I don’t think it is.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s time you learned that it is. We
aren’t made for anything else, my dear, you
and I; we’re ordinary women, and we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
make the best of it. You can’t imitate Dolly
Fane, so don’t try to.”</p>

<p>“It’s the very last thing I should do!”</p>

<p>“Well, go and beg the barbarian’s pardon,
then; she would never do that.” Maud had
a grudge against Dolly because she disliked
gossip.</p>

<p>“I <em>can’t</em>!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear child! You’re going to.
There’s your path; run along, like a good little
girl, and be sure you don’t tumble on your
nose.—And there’s half my bet won!”</p>

<p>Maud had sent her off with a maternal pat,
and Angela found herself going obediently.
Instinct led truer than reason. Down the
shadowy path she came blindly hurrying, and
ran full against Bernard, leaning motionless
against a tree.</p>

<p>“Angela!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” Angela said, with a sob.</p>

<p>Thus was peace established; but Angela soon
found that in yielding she had stooped to
conquer: her bear was transformed into a
lamb. She might live at Timbuctoo, if it
pleased her; she might wander through London
alone till one in the morning, though plainly
Bernard did not like the prospect.</p>

<p>“But, Bernard, why shouldn’t I?” Angela
cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span></p>

<p>“Because you’re so awfully pretty,” was the
surprising answer.</p>

<p>“Bernard! I thought you said I wasn’t
pretty!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where you got that idea
from.”</p>

<p>“You said you didn’t want me for my looks.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I; I should want you just the
same if you were like a gorilla.”</p>

<p>“But <em>do</em> you think me pretty?”</p>

<p>“I should hope so!”</p>

<p>“As pretty as Dolly?”</p>

<p>“Dolly? Dolly’s a milkmaid and you’re a
princess. Any one can see there’s no comparison.
Dolly’s well enough, barring her carroty
hair; but you’re so awfully distinguished-looking.
I don’t see why you want me to tell you
this; you must know it already.”</p>

<p>“I like compliments—I expect compliments;
that’s one of the things you have to learn.”</p>

<p>“It’ll come pretty easy. I shall only have
to say out what I think.”</p>

<p>“If you talk like that,” said Angela, “perhaps
I’ll let you take me about London, after
all. Now we must go back to the house; it’s
getting shamefully late.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go up yet.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Bernard looked down at her and laughed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
“All right,” he said; “I guess you mean to have
your own way.”</p>

<p>They came together slowly up the garden.
The gold rectangle of the uncurtained window
shone out in the dusk; the figures of Dolly and
of Mrs. Merton appeared on the balcony,
silhouetted against the light. Ella soon went
in, but Dolly lingered, gazing at the dusky
woods and the diamond gleam of the lake.
Suddenly another figure came swiftly up the
steps. Dolly turned at once towards the
window; the lamplight fell on her face. Lal
laid his hand on her arm and spoke in her ear:
a single sentence, no more. Bernard saw his
sister turn crimson. She answered briefly, broke
away, went into the house. Lal fell back into
the shadow.</p>

<p>“Did you see that?” whispered Angela.</p>

<p>“M’yes. I rather think I did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bernard! What did she say?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go in directly,” said Angela, in high
excitement.</p>

<p>On the balcony they passed Lal; but Lal’s
face was never the index of his feelings, and it
baffled curiosity. From the threshold Angela
looked round for Dolly, to discover that,
whatever had happened a minute ago, Dolly
was not thinking of it now. She stood, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
a group surrounding Norman Merton, who had
the evening paper and was reading aloud from
it. Pretty little Mrs. Merton was very grave,
her eyes soft with pity and distress; Maud
Prideaux looked horrified. Dolly’s face
Angela could not decipher; it was held by some
thought more powerful than pity or horror.</p>

<p>“‘... Had the explosion taken place five
minutes earlier the carnage must have been
frightful, and many families deprived of their
breadwinners. As it is, we regret to announce
the death of Mr. Lucian de Saumarez,
the well-known author, who was a partner in
the business, and of the manager, Mr. Smith
Charlesworth. Both were standing too close
to the scene of destruction to be able to escape.
It is feared that the bodies, which are buried
under a huge accumulation of débris, will never
be recovered. Much sympathy is felt for Mr.
Farquhar, who has been deprived at one blow
of his friend and his fortune—’”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Farquhar hurt?”</p>

<p>Dolly spoke out, careless who might hear.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Fane, Farquhar’s perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“Not hurt! How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“No one knows at present, but they seem
to think there was foul play.”</p>

<p>White as death, she turned away, listening
to no more. Lal, who had just come in, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
standing by the window; Dolly’s eyes sought
his. “Will you go out to Petit-Fays for me?”
Angela heard her say. And: “I will go wherever
you wish,” Lal answered without hesitation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII<br><br>
<span class="fs80">THE ONE SHALL BE TAKEN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">On the day after the meeting at Swanborough,
Noel Farquhar walked in upon
Lucian in his room and found him sitting in
his shirt and trousers trying to write. It was
intensely hot, and he had cast off his coat and
his waistcoat and his collar, his tie and his
boots, had posted open the door and flung wide
the window, and hung across a string of dripping
towels to keep out the sun. Nevertheless,
he was mopping his brow with a dirty old
penwiper-handkerchief, and his face was colourless
but for its tan.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said; “sit down and let me
swear at you for a bit; I’m tired of haranguing
a condemned desk that doesn’t respond.
What’s the matter, sonny? You look as blue
as a thunder-cloud with cholera-morbus.”</p>

<p>“Can you listen to business or can you not?”</p>

<p>“Ou ay, my trusty frien’; I’ve been chasing
my plot for two solid hours, and it’s clane
disthracted I am. I’ve got ‘chainless’ twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
on one page, and so sure as I put down that
blessed word I know I’ll have to tear up the
lot. There it goes!” He tore the sheets
across and across and flung them at the paper-basket.
“There was rather a sweet girl in it,
too; I’ll use her up some day for a three-thousander.
You were saying—”</p>

<p>“Will you come round the works with me
and Charlesworth?”</p>

<p>“What, again? I’ve done it once this day.”</p>

<p>“I want to go round in the dinner-hour,
while the men are out. There’s something up,
I’d swear it, and Charlesworth says the same.”</p>

<p>“If it’s anything exciting, I’m your man,”
said Lucian, completing his costume with a
pair of carpet slippers and a white pith helmet,
in which he looked as swarthy as a Hindoo.
“Anyway, this is the last time. Come on, and
I’ll post my letter to her on the way.”</p>

<p>He looked at Farquhar, gleefully anticipating
a flash of jealousy, and he had his wish. He
laughed, tossed up the letter and caught it,
and smote Farquhar on the shoulder as they
went down-stairs. “Only a fortnight more,
sonny, and then we shall know!”</p>

<p>But Farquhar did not find an answer.
Prudence and friendship combined to keep his
wild-beast jealousy in order, but he never
even tried to cast it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>In the porch they found Charlesworth
waiting impassive, drawn back into the shade.
Summer had come suddenly upon them with
a burning heat; the roads were padded with
dust, herbs drooped as if they were broken,
brick walls fumed like the outposts of Hades.
Creeping up from the south, certain blue, hazy
clouds, their scrolled rims tinged with amber
and saffron, were surely invading the sky. In
the quarry not a man was left; the intense heat,
radiated and reflected from the granite walls,
made the place a purgatory. Mica crystals
scintillated in the grey dust. The noonday
sun was shining straight down into the pit;
the shrunken river, like a strip of blue satin,
crept without coolness below along the cliffs;
only under the great rock, which stood out
now like a wen on the face of the hill, was any
shadow to be found. Towards that shade
Lucian promptly made his way, and there sat
down on a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>All the preliminaries were over, and the rock
was ready to be blasted. On three sides it
stood free, and across the fourth, at the back of
the block, ranged the drilled holes following the
line of fracture between the fine stone and the
coarser. With what care Charlesworth had
assigned and executed the boring and the
tamping Lucian knew; yet the quarry-master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
was now prepared to examine it all again,
patiently testing what could be tested, rigorously
fulfilling his duty according to the laws
of a pride which forbade imperfections. Farquhar
helped him; Lucian, who was really a
superfluous person, sat on his barrow and
gibed at both.</p>

<p>A steam-whistle called the men back to work
at one o’clock. Hidden behind the rock,
Lucian had a good view of them as they trooped
in, and he was surprised by their behaviour.
The Belgians are by nature friendly and polite;
as many as knew Lucian (and nine-tenths of
them did) had always for him a smile, a wave
of the hat, a word of kind greeting; but Charlesworth
was severely ignored. One youth went
to the length of a long nose behind the manager’s
back. An English lad of his own age forthwith
fell upon him, and after a brief and silent
struggle proceeded to wipe the ground with
his prostrate enemy until he craved for mercy;
but the boy had merely expressed the feelings
of his elders. Another point which perplexed
Lucian was the silence of the men; a few were
whispering together and glancing between
their words at Charlesworth, but the usual
lively chatter was not to be heard.</p>

<p>“Not much of the peace-on-earth business
here, is there?” Charlesworth remarked to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
philosopher on the wheelbarrow. “I don’t go
around in these lanes after sundown without my
revolver.”</p>

<p>“Think they’d go as far as that?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; they hate me like poison,
anyway. I can put up with that now we’ve
got this business through; I guess we’ll pretty
soon see who’s master here.”</p>

<p>Lucian nodded. He was not so sure as
Charlesworth that force is the best preventive
of rebellion; in fact, he held the heretical idea
that he could have managed the men better
himself.</p>

<p>“You going to stay here till the thing’s going
to pop?”</p>

<p>“I mean to stay right here till Mr. Farquhar’s
lighted the fuse. There’ll be time then
to clear out; it’ll take ten minutes before it
explodes. I don’t want any one meddling with
these cartridges.”</p>

<p>Lucian had no wish to face the sun before
he was forced to; he waited with Charlesworth
under the rock. Both were excited. Farquhar,
standing beside the igniter thirty feet
away, was noticeably nonchalant. The warning
whistle sounded at five minutes to two;
and, as so often before, the workers swarmed
away to places of shelter, some to the summit
of the pit, others into chambers cut in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
rock where no shock of explosion could reach
them. Farquhar gave them five minutes’ grace.
A bell sounded; and the watchers saw him
stoop and fire the fuse. Immediately Charlesworth
uncrossed his legs and stepped towards
the gate; and immediately after came a terrific
detonation, a terrific eruption of rock, black
smoke, and flame and fumes and flying crags;
and then the collapse, as it were, of the firmament
itself; and, lastly, darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those who saw it said that at the moment
of explosion a huge ball of smoke puffed out
and immediately came rolling over and over
in black convolutions, rent by ghastly chasms
and caverns of sulphurous gloom. They said
that the fire flashed out starwise, radiating in a
dozen spokes of gold from one common centre;
and that the second detonation (for there were
two) was more violent than the first. Farquhar
saw nothing of this. He was hurled to
the earth by the first shock and pinned down
there under the fragments during the second;
and when he found his senses and sat up he
came near fainting again, for the pit was
poisoned with fumes. He fell back, and,
lying face downward, breathed in the less
polluted lower air until the inrushing wind
had time to sweeten that above. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
made another effort, and began to shake off
the rocks which had fallen on him. He was
horribly bruised; another man would have
been disabled. But Farquhar was by nature
insensitive to suffering, and, besides, his will
scorned to submit to the weakness of his body;
he refused to be fettered by pain. This man
of many sins was not planning for his own
safety; he was remembering only that Lucian
had been standing under the rock destroyed,
and he swore at the impediments that delayed
him as though he could wither them up by
the fire of his curses. He struggled free, and
saw lying under him the fragments of the
detonator, with a length of fuse attached.
The appearance of the fuse surprised him, and
he took it up. Crossed threads of orange
worsted ran over it. By that mark he knew
it for what it was: not the ordinary slow fuse
which should have been used, but the other,
instantaneous kind, where gunpowder is replaced
by a quick match, which burns at the
rate of thirty feet per second. Now the cause
of the catastrophe was clear. Some one had
substituted this for the proper fuse, and, to
conceal the change, had picked out the distinctive
orange threads. Only this piece, hidden
in the body of the detonator, had escaped
notice to show the manner of their treachery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>

<p>Farquhar dismissed the authors of the crime
to perdition, along with their instrument.
Now he was standing up and could see the ruin
that had been wrought; the beautiful stone,
destined for such fine purposes, was shattered,
almost pulverized. It was not till afterwards,
when the evidence came to be weighed, that
he realised how this had come about; for the
substitution of the quick fuse should have
made a difference in the time of the explosion
but not in its results. The truth was that only
half the strands had been changed; the rest
were left as slow fuse; so that instead of one
there were two explosions, which, acting
separately, broke the rock to pieces. But
Farquhar cared little for his ruined enterprise.
He looked round the smoking amphitheatre, he
saw the faces of the men who had come with
him from England, who were of one blood with
those entombed; he lifted his arm, from which
the sleeve had been wrenched together with
part of the flesh, and called out to them in their
native tongue:</p>

<p>“Men, there are two Englishmen buried
under these rocks; it’s our business to get
them out.”</p>

<p>The strange acoustic properties of the quarry
carried his words to every man there. He put
a point to them by himself lifting a pick, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
the explosion had cast at his feet, and beginning
to work. In two minutes a dozen men
were working at his side; in ten, every soul,
native or foreign, was taking his part. To do
the men justice, murder had not been in their
thoughts; they had aimed only to spoil the
rock. If the manager, who usually fired the
mines, should happen to get hurt, it would be a
lamentable incident; but the presence of
Charlesworth and Lucian immediately under
the rock they had not foreseen, and, indeed,
had not known of till Farquhar spoke. Now
they could only hope to atone by willing labour.</p>

<p>Through all that long hot summer afternoon
they toiled and toiled and toiled. Men from
the village of Petit-Fays volunteered to relieve
those who were spent, and took their turn
with the pick in rotation, but Farquhar refused
to leave work. He tied a strip of linen
round his wounded arm, which grew more
painful when the muscles contracted; but he
went on digging. He knew that his immense
and disciplined strength had a special value.
Mentally he could not rest and physically he
would not, though the men began to look
at one another as the hours passed in vain.
Sunset found them still working; and the
gracious coolness of night with its million
stars. At last, at midnight, one of the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
workmen (the same whom Lucian had liked so
much) came to Farquhar and said, very respectfully:</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir, but is it any use going on?”</p>

<p>“Use? I should hope so,” said Farquhar,
straightening his shoulders and pushing back
his fair hair. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Me and my mates would be willing to work
on any time if there was any chance of getting
either of them out alive—”</p>

<p>“D’you mean to say you think there’s <em>no</em>
chance?”</p>

<p>“We’re afraid not, sir,” said the first man;
and a murmur of assent went up from the
others, who had left work and clustered round.
Farquhar’s brows came together, and he stared
at them as though he could not understand their
speech.</p>

<p>“You say there’s no chance? I say that’s
nonsense. I’d never have thought that Englishmen
would shirk.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t shirking,” said the spokesman,
rather proudly. “I’d lay there isn’t one of us
as wouldn’t be ready to work his hands off
if there was any chanst at all; but there ain’t,
not a mite. I seen a good many blow-ups in
my time, and I say there’s no man could be
living now after all that mess had fallen on
him. If they wasn’t killed outright they’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
have been stifled. Anybody as knows’ll say
the same.”</p>

<p>Again the murmured assent followed his
words.</p>

<p>Farquhar still stood staring, but his face
changed, cleared, hardened. Fever was running
riot in his veins, and he was not wholly
master of his words, else he would not have
laid such a charge against them; for he knew
it was not true. They had worked till they
were spent; the pose of their figures as they
waited showed it more plainly than words.
And against that mass of granite all their toil
seemed futile. Of what use to continue?</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, and I beg your pardon,
men. Knock off to-night, then; we’ll take a
fresh spell at it to-morrow, for I mean my
friends to have Christian burial. I shall see
that all you’ve done to-day is not forgotten.”</p>

<p>As he had first begun work, so now he was
first to leave off; he leaned his pick against
a stone and turned homeward. In ten minutes
the deserted quarry was left to the dews and
the night.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br><br>
<span class="fs80">THE OTHER LEFT</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Farquhar went home in a mood of black,
resentful anger, which he aimed, since his
creed disallowed a personal deity, at the callous
rocks and the soulless forces of nature. He
forgot grief as he had forgotten pain. He
walked on, swinging his injured arm and
cursing as he went; and in this temper he
came to the hotel, and received the sympathy
of a number of uninteresting people without
betraying a vestige of his actual sentiments.
They thought him magnanimous, heroic, oppressed
with bitter grief; and with the good
taste of their nation they left him alone with
his sorrow.</p>

<p>In the salon place was laid for one, and the
sight sickened Farquhar; it was like the turning
of a screw in his breast. He paced the room
for five minutes before he could bring himself
even to sit down. There were two letters for
him on his plate, blue on the thick white
china. Bills they seemed, enclosed in thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
blue envelopes of the ordinary oblong business
shape; he took them up idly and glanced at the
address. One was for him and one for Lucian:
both in Dolly Fane’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Farquhar tore the envelope open and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Farquhar</span>,—I have now made up my
mind upon the question which you asked me. If
you are still interested, and care to come and see
me next time you are in England, I will tell you my
decision.</p>

<p class="center">
“Sincerely yours,<br>
</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Mirabelle Fane</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The ink was bluish instead of black; the
postmark Dove Green instead of Monkswell;
the paper unlike Dolly’s stationery; but the
handwriting was unmistakable. Farquhar
crushed up the note in his strong fingers, as
though to weld it into a solid mass. That
she meant to reject him he could not doubt.
He took up Lucian’s letter; he saw with fierce
joy that she had omitted to seal it. Now at
last, then, had come the chance which he had
coveted, the chance of reading one of her
letters; and of them all he would most dearly
have desired to read this, wherein without
doubt she opened her heart to her lover. To
intrude into that sanctuary was the prime wish
of his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span></p>

<p>He called to Laurette for a basin of hot
water. If this last love-letter of his dead
friend were found torn open, he thought it
might seem strange; and he wished to keep
up to the end the fiction of his frank and
honourable nature. Laurette had been surprised
by his request for hot water; the smile
with which he thanked her sent her away wondering
whether he had gone mad. Farquhar
took care to lock her out before beginning his
delightful task. The water was steaming hot.
He held the flap of the envelope low down in
the vapour, intending to loosen the gum; the
thought that Lucian was dead and buried beyond
interference under several tons of granite
was sweeter than honey, though he would have
liked to bestow immortality upon Lucian’s
spirit, that he might see this desecration and be
powerless to protest. The paper turned grey
and began to curl up from the edges; it detached
itself from the underleaf with a small distinct
sound. Farquhar drew out the enclosure and
opened it with insolent triumph.</p>

<p>Long he sat there, motionless, the letter in
his hand; but he did not read one word of it.
After ten minutes he refolded it and replaced it
and resealed the envelope and laid it down.
He unlocked the door and called to Laurette:
“I’m going back to the quarry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>

<p>“But, monsieur, wherefore?”</p>

<p>“To find Mr. de Saumarez. Whether he’s
alive or dead, I’ll not rest till I have him.
Tell your brothers, if you like; I shall work,
whether I’m helped or no.” He passed her
by in the hall with a look so fierce and fell
that the girl shrank out of his way.</p>

<p>One o’clock. The sweet plaintive tone of
the church clock came down the valley from
Vresse as Farquhar began to work. That
mountain of granite, could he ever hope to
remove it? He could not hope, but he could
do it. He had gone through incredible exertions
on that day, he was brought into pain by
every stroke of the pick, he had neither hope to
strengthen him, nor that excitement kin to
delirium which had exalted him before to
exalt him now; but the strength of his single
will kept him unremittingly at the vain labour.
And the force at the back of his will was the
prime force of his life: devotion. All evil
passions in his nature had in turn ranged
themselves against that nobler quality, and
been defeated. If a man ever was the slave
of love, that was Noel Farquhar. He had
purpose and lust and will to leave Lucian
stifling under the granite, and to pry into his
letter, and to marry Dolly in triumph over his
grave; but that purpose and lust and will were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
bound by one stronger than he, and Noel
Farquhar was labouring under incalculable difficulties
to get for his friend the joy which he
coveted for himself.</p>

<p>Laurette’s three brothers presently joined
him, beginning to work in silence just over
the spot where Farquhar judged that the
victims were buried. The explosion had so
greatly altered the configuration of the hill that
certainty was not possible. Not one of the
three had handled a pick before, and at first
they damaged their own ankles more often than
they removed any granite. There was a gruesome
comicality in the scene; for Farquhar’s
silent fury of work seemed to hallow the place
like a church so that they dared not speak, and
the three young Belgians hopping about and
suppressing curses would have made Lucian
laugh in his grave could he have seen them.
Towards dawn a blood-red oval moon rose above
the pines and dropped a tremulous ladder of
crimson across the stream; white mists spun
ghost-dances over it. A cold change and a
strange wind heralded the day’s birth; the
dawn itself quickened its white pulse in an
empty sky. Virgin light came first, then
warmth and colour, like the pink flutings of a
shell, and the first timorous love-notes of the
birds; and the three brothers looked at one another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
and thought of <i lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, and wondered
how long the Englishman would continue to
work. They themselves did not pause; and
presently the youngest found his pick striking
against solid rock amid the shale. He tried
to work round it, but could not find the edge.
The others came to help him, and soon they
guessed that they had come on a large block
of granite, expelled from the cliff by the first
explosion, but hidden under the splinters from
the second. So massive was it that to split
it up by hand and cart it away seemed an impossibly
slow process; yet they dared not use
the blasting-powder, for the sake of what
might lie beneath. In this perplexity they
leaned on their picks and looked to Farquhar
for directions, Félix, the soft-handed <i lang="fr">pâtissier</i>,
surreptitiously wrapping his handkerchief round
his blistered fingers. Farquhar’s answer came
briefly: “Dig round it.”</p>

<p>They fell to work, and before long discovered
that, though the superficies of the block was
large, its depth was small; it was, as it were, a
scale split off the face of the cliff. Consequently,
they might hope to raise it by levers;
and again they turned to Farquhar for permission
to fetch them. But a sombre fire
dwelt in his eyes, and his answer came sternly:
“Dig deeper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>Wondering at first, then themselves infected
by his deep excitement, they obeyed him; and
suddenly little Gustave, with an involuntary
“Sacré!” fell flat on his face. The point of his
pick had gone through, under the slab, to some
cavity beneath. As Félix stooped to examine
it, Farquhar thrust him sans ceremony out
of the way and himself knelt down to explore.
He could not find bottom, and he sprang up
again, his excitement flaming out as he called
to them to widen the hole.</p>

<p>Now the toil went apace and the stones flew
ringing aside. A gap appeared, and widened.
Farquhar dropped on his knees and called,
“Lucian! Lucian!” No answer. Up again
and on with the work, and presently the gap
was wide enough to admit a man’s head.
Farquhar tried to crawl through, failed, and
set the youngest of the boys to try; but it
could not be done. Farquhar’s impatience
would not wait till the stone was uncovered.
He knelt again, and thrust his head and the
upper part of his shoulders under the slab;
then, resting his palms flat on the ground, he
put all his colossal strength forth into the effort
to raise it. It weighed—how much? Two
tons, the eldest youth hazarded: a guess certainly
exaggerated; for, as they watched, fascinated
by the display of a power such as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
had never imagined, fearing each moment to
see him fail and faint, as they gazed and
listened they heard the creakings of rending
rocks and saw the gap grinning wider and
Farquhar slowly raising himself on his hands
and his bent arms straightening out till they
stood firm as columns upbearing the architrave
of a temple—until Farquhar stopped, and
paused to see if the slab would subside, and
then rose to his feet, white as ashes, his face
seamed with grim lines and streaming with
sweat. “Get a light,” he said. “I’m going
in.”</p>

<p>One of them had a box of the odious little
sulphur-matches so common abroad, which
kindle with difficulty and burn at first with a
blue light and an inexpressible smell, but are
not easily extinguished. Neither had a candle,
and neither was in the mood to go and fetch one.
Farquhar struck several matches at once, and
so soon as they burned steadily stepped down
into the darkness. They could see the flame
illumining his hair and reddening the side of his
face, but of the aspect of the vault, nothing.
Then they went out, or, rather, he dropped
them. Sick with excitement, they heard him
saying, in commonplace tones:</p>

<p>“Lend a hand, will you? I can’t get them
up over the edge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span></p>

<p>He had Lucian’s body in his arms then, and,
leaning downward into the dark, the three boys
succeeded in dragging him into the air. Charlesworth’s
huge frame was extricated with more
difficulty; after, came Farquhar himself, who
needed no help. He left Charlesworth to live
or die as fate decreed, and went straight to
Lucian.</p>

<p>Neither was dead, though Lucian was near it;
long after Charlesworth was able to speak and
walk, and even help to revive his companion in
suffocation, he still lay deeply unconscious.
His frail life was so easily imperilled; and they
had first been half poisoned by fumes and
afterwards half stifled by their own breath.
At the first explosion the slab had split off
and fallen like a roof above them; the second
blast piled rocks upon it and made it the
roof of a tomb. All this Charlesworth narrated
as he sat fanning Lucian’s face, himself deathly
white, with a jagged gash under his ear.
Lucian looked like death itself, but still he
breathed; and with the aid of copious douches
of fresh water they brought him at last to
consciousness. Farquhar straightway threw
him over his shoulder and carried him to the
hotel, leaving Charlesworth to follow as he
might. Sad to say, the first use which Lucian
made of his recovered speech was to murmur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
feebly at intervals, “I’m drunk—I’m drunk—O
take me home to ma!”</p>

<p>At the hotel they received something like
an ovation; and before ten minutes had passed
Laurette had told her aunt in the village, and
the aunt her husband, and half the men in
Vresse were hurrying out to give welcome.
Nothing would content them but that Farquhar
should make an oration; and when he
came out on the balcony, a ghastly figure with
his bloodless face and the blood-stained bandage
stained afresh on his arm, they cheered
him like a king. Never was any one in Vresse
so popular as the unpopular English master;
they adored him for purging them from the guilt
of blood. Even Charlesworth came in for a
share of the glorification, because he had not
let himself be murdered; and when they had
shouted themselves hoarse, and trampled down
all the tobacco growing in Laurette’s garden,
and drunk six glasses apiece of Laurette’s most
innocent beer, they went home wildly enthusiastic
and perfectly sober. Farquhar, having
displayed his scars for their edification with his
usual ironical smile, went to his room to wash
and change before visiting Lucian. He conceived
that for the present he would have no more
trouble with his workmen. Then, at last, he took
the two blue letters and went to Lucian’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>The invalid was lying dressed upon the sofa;
he had endured the doctor, had refused to go
to bed, and was now ready to discuss his experience
with gusto. He had already been doing
so with Charlesworth, who got up from a
chair by the sofa when Farquhar came in.
The invalid at once patted the chair.</p>

<p>“Sit down, sit down,” he said, hospitably.
“Let’s fight our battles all o’er again. I’ve
been taking notes of everybody’s sensations
all round, and I’m going to write a realistic
Christmas-number tale—‘The Tragedy of Penywern
Quarry; or, Little Willy Wears Poor
Father’s Pants.’ How’s that for a title, hey?”</p>

<p>Charlesworth, however, declined to criticise.
“I’ve got to thank you for my life, sir,” he said,
looking Farquhar straight in the face, as he
always did. “If we’d stayed in that hole till
the shovel-and-pick department nosed us out
to-day or to-morrow, I guess they’d have got
empty shells for their pains. Now I’ve a use
for my life, and so has my wife. I don’t know
whether gratitude’s any use to you, sir, but
you may count on mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Farquhar, easily.
But he met and returned Charlesworth’s look
with some degree of honesty; and when Farquhar
was honest his eyes had the latent
dangerous cruelty of one of the great cats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
panther or leopard or tiger, and they showed
the force of a will keen as a knife-blade to cut
through obstacles. Charlesworth recognised
these two unpleasant qualities and did not
flinch; perhaps he had guessed that Farquhar
was too good to be true. His steadiness called
out a glint of satisfaction; when they had
shaken hands, each felt this encounter to be
the foundation of a friendship. “You’ll continue
as manager?” Farquhar said, as the
American was going; and, “While you want
me, sir,” came the proudly respectful reply.</p>

<p>Farquhar was left alone with Lucian; the
reckoning hour had come.</p>

<p>Lucian was looking after Charlesworth with
a lamentable air. “I like that man, but he
don’t care a red cent for me,” he said, pathetically.
“He makes me feel so awfully small that
I’m only fit for a microscope. And yet I’m
sure I’ve been splendidly heroic. I had a
splitting headache, and I never once let on.
Though, to be sure, he mightn’t have known
that. What are you looking so down in the
mouth for, sonny?”</p>

<p>Farquhar flung the letter at him and turned
on his heel; he stood staring out of the window,
his hands thrust deep in his pockets and clenched
there. He heard Lucian’s “Hullo!” the
tearing of the envelope, the withdrawal of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
folded sheet grating against the torn flap.
Then Lucian sprang off the sofa and came
and dropped a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad, old man, and that’s the
truth,” he said. “I knew you’d win.”</p>

<p>Farquhar wheeled round. “What’s that
you say?”</p>

<p>“Congratulations: that’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean by such
damnable nonsense as this?”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t she written to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, confound her! I tell you, I was
thirsting to leave you to die there, and rot,
till the worms had done with you. I’d have
given my right hand to do it. I’d have given
my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Lucian. “You would, would
you? Why didn’t you, then?”</p>

<p>“Confound you! What do you mean by
asking such a question as that? You know
well enough. Well, then, take her, and enjoy
yourself. Mind you, I’ve given you back to
her. You owe every second of joy you get out
of her to me. And don’t you come playing
the fool with your congratulations; I’d not
swear but that some day I wouldn’t pick you

two, as I very well could. You’ll be feebler
than your wife is, Lucian de Saumarez.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<p>“Has she been writing to you?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told you so?—curse her!”</p>

<p>“What does she say?”</p>

<p>“What does she say to you?”</p>

<p>They stood watching each other like stags
preparing to fight. Then Lucian held out his
letter. Farquhar held out his in return and
took Lucian’s with his other hand; the letters
changed owners simultaneously. Farquhar devoured
the open page in an instant:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. de Saumarez</span>,—I have now made up
my mind upon the question which you asked me.
If you are still interested, and care to come and see
me next time you are in England, I will tell you
my decision.</p>

<p class="center">
“Sincerely yours,<br>

“<span class="smcap">Mirabelle Fane</span>.”<br>

<p>“God! When’s the next train?” said Farquhar.</p>

<span class="fs80">ROMANCE BRINGS UP THE NINE-FIFTEEN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">Four o’clock at Gedinne station, thirteen
miles from Vresse. Rain was streaming
down in torrents, yet of the two passengers
waiting for the train only one was under the
shelter; and when the other in momentary
absence of mind came under the glass, the first
vacated his seat and took refuge in the storm.
There he stayed, keeping an immovable face
while the wind lashed him and the grey lances
of rain assailed him, staring steadily at the
silver-and-golden line along the horizon under
the storm-cloud, and the amber glow which
was slowly transfusing the sombre brown
swells of vapour. Mademoiselle Hélène-Marie-Denise
Bonin-Watelot, the signal-man’s eldest
hope, with whom Farquhar had conscientiously
made friends on his journeys to Brussels, came
up and told him the number of the forks she
had washed and the nature of the garters which
she wore; but she got no <i lang="fr">pralines</i> to-day from
the big pocket in the overcoat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p>

<p>When the train came in, the rivals got into
different carriages as far apart as might be.
Glad enough were they to be moving at all,
though they stopped at every station. No
lover journeying to his bride, nor widow
hurrying to the sick-bed of her only son, ever
found the giant steam more laggard. Five
o’clock brought them to Houyet, where they
changed trains and had their second encounter;
for the platform was crowded, and Farquhar,
springing into an empty seat at the moment
before their start, found himself face to face
with Lucian, and fled out again with an
exclamation which the Belgian ladies, sitting
stout and placid in an atmosphere of indescribable
tobacco, luckily did not understand.
Lucian, spite of his anxiety, nearly choked
with laughter to see his friend hurrying into
the company of three babies and a nurse, in
preference to travelling up with him. Farquhar
had a delightful journey; he stood all the
way to Dinant and enjoyed a chorus of wails
at every tunnel.</p>

<p>Six o’clock: Dinant sailed into sight and
brought their third change. And now they
had to wait for a full half-hour. The rain
was done; the sunlight streamed over the
earth like a tissue of gold, and across the blue
sky floated low huge masses of dove-grey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
cloud, clear-edged with pearl, and higher, motionless
as though painted on the motionless
dome, long plumes of immaculate white widened
out to the wind. The indefatigable artist tried
to describe the scene with a stump of lead-pencil
on the back of Dolly’s letter while he waited.</p>

<p>Travelling up through the lovely rocky
valley of the Meuse, bright-hung with rain-drops,
Farquhar sat watch in hand counting
the minutes; for their train was late, and
there was a doubt whether it could catch the
main-line connection at Namur, and if they
failed in that they could not cross that night
and must wait a whole day more ere hearing
Dolly’s decree. Seven found them passing
Yvoir, the sky bare of clouds, and the wide
Meuse rosing herself in the sunset’s glow,
which stained the very granite cliffs and dyed
the green of young leaves madder-brown.
Half-past seven: they were coming into Namur
station, ten minutes late, and the Brussels
express was due. Standing up, Farquhar held
himself in readiness. Before the wheels were
still he had sprung out, leaping with the train
to balance his initial velocity, and was running
along the platform towards the main line,
for he knew his way. Lucian did not know
his way, but he did not stay to ask it; he ran
after Farquhar. There was a crowd, and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
stout Belgians, excitedly discussing the wonderful
rescue at Vresse, got right in his way:
as he reached the platform the train began to
move, and Lucian, who was too much exhausted
to do more than just clutch at the
foot-board, would certainly have been left had
not somebody opened the door of a first-class
carriage and hauled him in by the collar and
tail of his coat. Lucian collapsed, utterly
spent, his face as white as paper; the stranger
ministered to his needs with half a glass of
brandy, and assisted him to a seat. There
Lucian lay with his eyes shut for several
minutes before he found energy even to feel
curiosity concerning his saviour. To a person
of Lucian’s inquisitive temper, three minutes is
an æon of time.</p>

<p>When his heart had moderated its suffocating
pulsations and his eyes had ceased to swim,
he made use of them, and discovered that his
companion was a slight, fair-haired, good-looking
young Englishman dressed in grey—who
was watching him with a good deal of friendliness
out of a pair of dark-grey eyes. Lucian
smiled back and gave him a military salute,
being still beyond speech.</p>

<p>“You were almost left behind,” said the
stranger. Lucian nodded. “I hope I didn’t
tear your coat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span></p>

<p>Lucian put up his hand and found a long rent,
but he smiled on. “No, it’s all right, thanks.
I’m no end obliged to you. I was dead set on
catching this train; there’d have been Holy
Moses to settle if I’d missed it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad.”</p>

<p>“You crossing to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going back,” said the stranger,
taking a paper out of his bag. Lucian made
a bet with himself as to what that paper
would be, and transferred a sixpence from the
right-hand pocket of his coat to the left when
the <cite>Spectator</cite> came into view. The <cite>Engineer
Journal</cite> followed. “Oho!” said Lucian to himself;
“a soldier of the king, my friend, are you?
That’s why you look so smart.” He went
on aloud: “I’ve a kind of idea you saved my
life, you know.”</p>

<p>“By pulling you in? Surely not.”</p>

<p>“No-o; not that way. By the kindly, felicitous,
and opportunitatious administration of
O. D. V.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to run if you have trouble
with your heart,” said the stranger, unfolding
the <cite>Spectator</cite> preparatory to beginning to read.</p>

<p>“Thirteen different sawboneses have told
me that very same thing,” Lucian confessed;
“but it’s one of those things no fellow can
remember.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>“I dare say it is difficult,” the stranger
assented, his eyes on the printed page.</p>

<p>In face of that august <cite>Spectator</cite>, Lucian had
not the impudence to go on talking, though his
own thoughts were far from pleasant company.
He amused himself by studying the delicate
and rather feminine profile and the long eyelashes
of his vis-à-vis, trying from them to read
his character and from his clothes his position
and prospects; and the longer he looked the
more certain he grew that both should be known
to him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whistled Lucian softly to himself, trying to
fit together fragments of memory, as in one
of those terrible improving Scripture puzzles
which had haunted the Sundays of his childhood.
Bright sunshine, an architrave of light-coloured
wood framing an open door, and some
bright figure standing beside him: his brain
served up these scraps of information, but he
could not complete the picture. His feverish
mind had cooled. Lucian was not by nature
excitable; it was the electrical influence of
Farquhar’s stormy temperament which threw
him off his balance, and in his wildest movements
he was never mastered by a single motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
and passion to the exclusion of every other, as
happened to Farquhar. So now, anxiety respecting
Dolly lay like a core of ice within his
heart while the surface of his fertile brain was
occupied in weaving a romantic secret history
for the quiet young aristocrat of the <cite>Spectator</cite>.
By the time they had reached Brussels he had
made him a bigamist inclining to trigamy, and
was only not sure whether he had poisoned his
first wife or his mother.</p>

<p>Nine, ten, half-past. Darkness had fallen,
spangled with stars, and the southwest wind
came sweeping across the sky with a full and
steady pressure which reminded Lucian of the
strong blue tide of the Trades. Brussels
sparkling in lights lay far behind, and Ghent
was passed, and they tore through Bruges
with three screeches, leaving a trail of opalescent
smoke threaded with fire, and noisily rocking
and stuffily smelling as a Belgian train alone
can. Over the wide flat lands they raced, with
a throbbing repeated in triplets as clear as
the gait of a galloping horse. No tunnels were
here; a grating rush and a roar told when they
passed a canal and mirrored their square golden
windows one after one in the glass of the water,
so dark and so still. Lucian leaned out, received
a peppering of grit from the engine,
and got his first breath of the sea. There in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
west the sky glowed over Ostend. He relegated
the aristocratic stranger to a prison
dark and drear, with prospects of the gallows,
and turned from his own fancies to face the
facts of life. Years dropped away like dead
leaves; he lived again through the hours when
he gambled with Meryon while his wife lay
dead above. In those hours he had come to
know despair; and now, displacing the veils
which resolute courage drew across the face of
truth, he saw the same inexorable lineaments
confronting him. He had met them now in
every path of life. He was a failure: Dolly
was not for him. He had known this, while
refusing to believe; he did acknowledge it now,
and reached the nadir of his troubles before
the final sentence fell.</p>

<p>“We shall have a rough crossing,” said the
stranger, folding up his paper. “Are you a
good sailor?”</p>

<p>“Tolerably vile; are you?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be worse,” said the stranger,
laughing. “Do you go below?”</p>

<p>“No; I lie where I fall and abide in my
misery until my journey’s end. <i lang="la">Sic transit</i> is
my motto; and sick it always is, too.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get wet through if you stay on deck
to-night. Why don’t you try a private cabin?
They’re comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span></p>

<p>“To tell the plain but honest truth,” said
Lucian, cheerfully leaning back and stretching
a pair of muddy boots on the opposite seat,
“because I’m clean cleaned out. I’ve nothing
but my fare up from Dover.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>The stranger stood up to lift down his bag
and put on his overcoat, in all of which actions
he was as neat and quiet and dainty as a cat.
After a short pause he turned to Lucian again
and said, with some hesitation, “I shall have
a deck cabin myself; will you share it?”</p>

<p>“I shall be awfully ill,” said Lucian, very
much amazed.</p>

<p>“So shall I.”</p>

<p>“Well, under those circumstances you may
be grateful and comforting; I’m disgusting.
Sure you want me?”</p>

<p>“If I did not I should not have asked you,”
said the stranger concisely.</p>

<p>“It’s really remarkably good of you.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled; thanks very much.”</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Lucian and Lal
crossed the Channel in one cabin, and very
ill were they both, especially Lal, who suffered
like a martyr, without one groan. He
could hardly have done a thing more unselfish
than this, but, unluckily, his conscience was too
lofty-minded to applaud him for a sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
merely of personal dignity. Virtue failed to
reward itself here. Moreover, he was partly
of opinion that he had made a fool of himself
in making friends with a stranger. The hollow
sound of Lucian’s cough and the mournful
display of dripping passengers at Dover were
consolatory, inasmuch as they permitted him
to father his impulsive behaviour on common
humanity.</p>

<p>Of those, dripping passengers Farquhar was
the wettest and least pitiable. For the past
four hours he had been leaning over the bows,
watching the speed of the steamer, and formulating
arguments that should be urgent
enough to procure him a special at Dover.
Those arguments only failed because the thing
was impossible. Cursing high and cursing low,
Farquhar went to look at a time-table, and
found that the quickest way to reach Monkswell
was by going straight past it in the express
up to London, and coming down again by the
slow. He went off to take his ticket, confident
that though he and his rival might
arrive at Monkswell together he would yet
be the first to see Dolly at Fanes. How that
could be was his secret.</p>

<p>But they did not arrive at Monkswell together.
Lucian’s unrecognised friend had a
mind to follow Farquhar’s plan, and he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
up by the express; Lucian bade him good-bye
and remained at Dover. When crossing in the
spring he had made the acquaintance of a
porter; between the station and the pier they
had become intimate friends. Lucian sought
out this man now, and by dint of much persuasive
eloquence seduced him into an alliance.
There was no slow train up for some hours;
but a goods train started immediately after the
express. The porter and Lucian both talked
to the driver of that engine from the time the
boat came in till the goods train went off,
and after its departure Lucian was no more
to be seen at Dover Priory. It was strictly
against the rules, no doubt, but rules are
not unbreakable. The consequence was that
Lucian was turned out at Faversham Junction
at three in the morning, and there waited
until a slow train up from the Kent coast-line
carried him on to Monkswell.</p>

<p>First of the three, Lucian reached the station
at ten minutes to seven, and set off to walk
to Fanes, at two miles’ distance. He was
utterly tired; the exhaustion of the previous
day’s adventures, capped by a long journey,
bad sea-sickness, a sleepless night, and exciting
anxiety, weighed down each step he made.
He had had nothing to eat, feeling disinclined
at Dover and lacking the chance at Monkswell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
The familiar morning-scented country lanes
spun round him as he went.</p>

<p>Nine minutes after the up, the down train
from town came in, bringing Noel Farquhar and
Lal Laurenson. Seeing each other for the first
time on the platform, they saluted distantly.
Lal passed straight out of the station from the
down platform, whence a field path led past
the station-master’s pigsties and clothes-line to
the road. Farquhar crossed over to the main
buildings of the station, on the up platform,
and there in the yard found his dog-cart waiting
with an extremely sleepy groom. This was
his trump card; he had telegraphed to Simpson
from Gedinne before ever they started; by this
he hoped to forestall Lucian at Fanes. And
now all three had entered on the final stage of
their journey.</p>

<p>Farquhar’s dog-cart flew down the hill and
under the railway arch, noiselessly running
on its rubber tyres: past the surgery and
through the village and on into the country
lanes, long tunnels of green sprinkled with
sunlight. The irreproachable Simpson still sat
behind. They turned a sharp corner, and the
horse shied across the road: Farquhar checked
him mercilessly, glanced back to see the cause
of offence, and pulled him up short. Lucian sat
clasping his knees by the way-side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>He looked up; consciousness of defeat
blent with laughing and charitable defiance
was writ on his face; impotent anger
and deadly impatience on Farquhar’s. He
tossed the reins to his groom with a curt,
“Hold that,” sprang down, and went to Lucian.</p>

<p>“Come, will you? Confound you!”</p>

<p>Lucian’s face changed. “Going to give me a
lift, sonny?”</p>

<p>“D’you suppose I can leave you here?”</p>

<p>“Right, then; I’m dead beat.”</p>

<p>For the second time Farquhar picked him
up and deposited him in the dog-cart; and they
drove on together.</p>

<p>Half a mile beyond this the gates of Fanes
confronted the road. As the horse slackened
to ascend the hill, the groom jumped down
to throw them open, but when he turned he
saw that they were open already, and that his
master’s carriage was vanishing down the slope.
He ran after it for a little way; then with great
philosophy relapsed among the bushes and got
out his pipe.</p>

<p>Farquhar drove noiselessly down the smooth
yellow drive between snow-wreathed acacias,
past the stream and past the lawn
and past the rookery, till at the turn of the
path where it widened to the sweep and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
house came in sight, he again pulled up with a
jerk.</p>

<p>In the fresh morning sunshine before the
open door stood Dolly, in her blue frock, calling
the pigeons to be fed. They sailed down to
her, blue, and fawn, and white as snow, settling
around and upon her, and she scattered handfuls
of grain which glittered like gold. Her
milk-white skin, her chestnut hair, her cornflower
dress were bright and pure in colour as the
sunlight itself. One pigeon floated down with
outspread quiet wings and alit on her bare head,
and she laughed as she shook it off: a careless
laugh, a free gesture, which brought the blood
to Lucian’s face. Then Farquhar’s hand fell
on his arm, and he saw what he had not seen
before, what Dolly, with her back turned, still
did not see: the figure of a young man in a
grey suit in the act of leaning a bicycle against
the wall, a bicycle which unkindly refused to
stand. He settled it at last, came noiselessly
behind, and slipped his arm round the curve of
her waist.</p>

<p>Dolly turned to him; the watchers saw her
colour blossom and the breaking of light over
her beautiful, vivid young face, as her basket
slid down the curve of her drooping arm and
spilled her golden store.</p>

<p>“You!” she said. “Back already! I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
wished ten times an hour I’d never sent you,
Lal.”</p>

<p>Lucian shut his eyes. Farquhar, without a
word, dragged the chestnut round and lashed
him till he went flying back up the drive,
scattering pebbles at every step.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XX">XX<br><br>
<span class="fs80">SO THEY TWO WENT ON</span></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">In the break that followed, both turned
and looked after the dog-cart. Dolly spoke
first. “There!” she said, clasping her hands
together; “now it’s done!”</p>

<p>“They had no business to listen,” Lal said.
It was his embarrassment that spoke, but Dolly
turned on him in a flash. “Lucian listen?
Lucian would no more listen than you would.
They could not help seeing.” Again she
pressed her hands together, and let them
drop at her side with a gesture unconsciously
tragic. “I wish it had not happened so, Lal!”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you like him; he’s very
attractive.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry for him!” She lifted her
candid eyes. “Because I say little, never
think I don’t feel. Well, it can’t be helped
now.” She turned the basket upside down
over the pigeons crowding round her feet, and
brushed the husks from her skirt. “Did you
bring them back with you? Did you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
they were coming? Last night’s paper said
they were rescued, no more.”</p>

<p>Lal gave her an evening journal, price three
centimes, whose themes were murder and
sudden death and the seventh commandment,
all printed in vile black type upon villanous
drab paper. “When I got to Namur I saw
this. I thought it useless to go on,” he said,
while Dolly skimmed through a highly sensational
narrative of Farquhar’s heroism and
Lucian’s fortitude. “I actually travelled in
the same carriage with De Saumarez, but I did
not recognise him. Last time we met I think
he had not shaved for several days,” he finished,
with a smile. Dolly let her paper drop against
her skirt.</p>

<p>“I never should have sent you, Lal; I ought
to have known better. I to think he had
hurt Lucian! Oh, I have been a fool. A baby
could not be more harmless than Noel Farquhar
when he cares for any one; and he does
care for Lucian. There, I’ve been in the wrong
all through. I like him; I like both of them.
This is a hateful affair. I wonder, I do wonder
what they’ll do.”</p>

<p>“I should fancy that Farquhar will console
himself within the year,” said Lal, perversely.
“I’m very sorry for De Saumarez.”</p>

<p>“That is sheer prejudice. Lucian is far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
likely to get over it soon than Noel Farquhar.
In fact, I don’t believe he ever will get over it.
Well!” She looked away at the golden sky,
sighing, her brows drawn down. “I can’t go
to them myself, that’s certain, nor can you.
I must write and explain, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Dolly,” Lal said, detaining her, “you have
never told me which, after all, you meant to
take when you summoned them in that fashion.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you’ll think me a fool,” Dolly
said, after a pause. “I hate vacillating people
myself; but the truth is—I could <em>not</em> make
up my mind. I could hardly bear to refuse
Lucian; yet Noel Farquhar fascinated me, I
don’t deny it. His is such a strong character,
and he did care for me. Then Lucian was
penniless, while Mr. Farquhar was rich and in a
good position; and I’m ambitious, Lal. Besides,
Bernard was continually warning me
against him. And I was so completely in love
with you that I did not very much care what
I did with myself. You <em>did</em> trouble me so,”
she broke off, her voice softening to a richer
inflection. “You almost broke my heart. I
was so proud of you for being what you are;
and to find you in that place! I could have
died for grief; I could have beaten out my
eyes for seeing it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dolly!” said Lal, and bent down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
quickly to kiss her. The shy, swift, furtive
movement brought tears to Dolly’s eyes.
There was reverence in his touch, there was even
awe; and so, for the first time, Dolly tasted
the grace of true humility.</p>

<p>“Well”—she picked up the thread of her
confession with a sigh—“I suppose it has to be
told. As I say, I could not see what to do;
and I did not care myself; and Bernard would
advise me till I was mazed with thinking. So
I ended by leaving it to chance.”</p>

<p>“And how did you settle it?”</p>

<p>“I said I would accept the one who reached
me first.”</p>

<p>“I reached you first, Dolly.”</p>

<p>“And do you want more of me than you’ve
got?” Dolly said, turning on him her face, full
of sweetness and fire.</p>

<p>“What have I got? A bare ‘Yes,’ and
nothing more!”</p>

<p>“Your own fault, for asking such a question
in such a place. I longed to sink into the ground.
Besides, I gave you the promise of my marriage
vows; isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“What marriage vows?”</p>

<p>“Love; honour; obedience.”</p>

<p>“Love—honour,” Lal repeated, strongly
moved. “Do you give those to me, Dolly?
You make me ashamed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p>“You know I give them. I give everything.”</p>

<p>“Even obedience? Dolly, will you ever
obey anybody?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I shall,” Dolly said, with proud
humility. “I take my stand with other women;
we all promise to obey, and I shall obey.
I always keep my promises. There, dearest,
let me go now and write. Afterwards—”</p>

<p>Noel Farquhar came into his library at The
Lilacs and unlocked his writing-table, one of
those elegant roll-top American contrivances
full of drawers and pigeon-holes. He took out
his blotter, his writing-paper, and his revolver.
He made sure that this was properly loaded,
and then dipped pen in ink and began to write.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I wish it clearly to be understood
that I write in sound physical health, and that my
brain is not, and never has been, in danger of insanity.
I purpose shortly to commit suicide by shooting myself,
and I do not wish my body to receive rites in
which I never have had a shadow of belief. In plain
English, I, not being a Christian, do not desire Christian
burial. I have neither hope nor wish for a joyful
resurrection. This has been my lifelong creed.
I have been at the pains to belie it, and live as the
model of virtue, both in public and private, in order
to earn the esteem of my respectable British fellow-citizens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
I challenge any man living to say I have
not succeeded. Honesty is unquestionably the best
policy for the man who wishes to thrive: <i lang="la">experto
crede</i>. I would not wish to die with a lie on my lips;
the taste of truth is pleasantly novel.</p>

<p>“Within the last few months the issue of a love-affair,
together with certain pecuniary losses which
endanger my political position, have contrived to
make life uninteresting, and even burdensome. I
see no chance of improvement, and have not the patience
to undergo present discomfort in the vague
hope of a problematical future gain. I take the only
logical course. In shooting myself I carry out a purpose
conditionally framed as soon as I was old enough
to think for myself. Let me again repeat that I am
not mad; and let me beg, let me beseech the twelve
worthy gentlemen who shall sit upon my body to burden
their consciences with no unnecessary perjury,
but to cap the inquest with a truthful verdict of <i lang="la">felo
de se</i>.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, I commend to my biographers the
study of my birthplace, parentage, and nationality.
I refer them for information to the records of the
province of Kiew, South Russia.</p>

</p>

<p>“The Lilacs, Monkswell, 2/7/03.”</p>

<p>When he had finished, he read over the letter
with satisfaction. While he was so doing,
somebody opened the door and came noiselessly
in. Farquhar glanced angrily over his shoulder;
but, seeing only Lucian de Saumarez, he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
on with his reading, after taking the precaution
of drawing his blotter across the revolver
to hide it. With an indescribably guilty and
shamefaced air, like a dog that has been caught
stealing, Lucian went and lay down on the sofa.
He was holding a handkerchief to his lips.</p>

<p>Farquhar closed the letter and took the
revolver, glancing again at Lucian. Lucian
heard the movement, turned his head, and for
the moment took away the stained handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Farquhar, old man—” he began; he could
not get any further.</p>

<p>Farquhar set his teeth on his underlip and
swore. He sat immovable, looking dangerous,
all rebellion; and then the inevitable law of his
nature asserted itself, as it had done before, as
in him it always would: the power that held
him in bondage. He tore the letter across and
across and across again and flung the fragments
into the grate; he took up the revolver by the
barrel and hurled it through the window across
the flower-beds into the fountain on the lawn.
He came and knelt by Lucian’s side, and lifted
him with fierce tenderness against his breast.</p>

<p>“Confound you! What have you been doing
to yourself?” he said.</p>
